cookbook

Tools & techniques

Last update: November, 2017

Intended for internal use

Overview

Short explanation of the 3 phases


This book is an ongoing effort to gather the best tools and techniques at Namahn. Every Namahni is invited to update the recipies or add new ones.

The tools are designed to use in co-creative workshops, together with your client (cross department), end users and other stakeholders.

They explicit the reasoning of "design' experts in order that non-experts can step into the design process without necessarily having to know the rationale or thereotical frameworks behind them. The rationale and frameworks where they are based upon are listed in the references.

It is called a cookbook because you must never forget that all you do in workshop is gathering the ingredients for the meal. After the workshop you still have to cook and as you know there are top-chefs, amateur-cooks an even lousy cooks.

Content inventory

What

A content inventory is a detailed evaluation of the existing content on a site or intranet. A content inventory refers to a detailed listing of all content 'objects' (pages, documents"¦). A content audit refers to more qualitative evaluation of the content.

Why

The aim of the content inventory is getting a good look at the structure and diving into the details of the website content helps better understand what information is there and how it is structured.

How

Desk research, executed individually.


Preparing

Doing

Identify the pages on the site: start from the homepage. Link all the possible paths from there, often apparent from the top navigation. Repeat for all other pages, but remember to work in hierarchical levels. Look for sitemaps to help you understand the site structure.
For each page you identify, gather meta information:
Basic information: Page title, URL, level within the hierarchy, format (web page/pdf/"¦), languages
Usage information: number of visits (popularity), last update"¦
Qualitative assessment (optional): usability, findability, accuracy"¦
When you have finished the inventory, highlight the main findings and draw a number of overall conclusions to include in the reporting for the client.
Processing results

The content inventory will be delivered in the form of a spreadsheet or mindmap.

Use a mind map for a quick & dirty content inventory; use an excel sheet for a more detailed content inventory, with meta information for each page.
If it"s a public domain name, consider using a crawler or other web-indexing software.

Expert review

What

An expert review is a heuristic evaluation technique for sites or application, executed by a multi-disciplinary team of experts using a checklist in a joint session

Why

The purpose of the technique is to provide critique of the current state as well as recommendations for improvement. Use this technique when you want to focus on the overall usability of the application only.

How

In the expert review, design experts evaluate the qualities of [name of product] following a checklist containing indicators to evaluate usability, learnability, accessibility, coding, fun, etc.


Preparing

Briefing - [Client] briefs Namahn about the pig picture, scope of the review and the focal points
Briefing pack - Namahn prepares a briefing pack with instructions for the experts and directions to access the product in some form or another
Individual study " The design experts, individually, review the [name of product] for [n] hours
Doing

Expert review workshop - During the workshop the design advisors review and discuss the product in detail, registering issues and recommending and drawing remedial action.
One way of proceeding is to note the issues on seperate post-its, and then cluster and denominate the themes.
Another way to proceed is to ask a junior designer to take notes during the session. You will cluster and look for the themes afterwards.
Processing results

Expert reviews results in a report listing the main issues & suggesting improvements and solutions for the site or application. Reports usually include visual examples of the issues with callouts, charts to illustrate the data, discussions of best practice, and actionable recommendations.
Instead of noting each instance of a problem, you can note just one example, indicate that it"s prevalent throughout the user interface, and describe the impact that has overall."Jim Ross
Prioritize the issues, depending on the business needs and the purpose of the expert review."Drew Davidson

Competitive analysis

What

Competitive analysis is a technique to Identify and evaluate the competition in the marketplace.

Why

The purpose of compatitive analysis is to evaluate how a given product"s competition stacks up against usability standards and overall user experience and to generate ideas on how to solve various usability issues

How

Competitive reviews can be done in conjunction with the 'expert review'. If doing both a competitive and expert review, it"s helpful to start out with the competitive review and then conduct the expert review using the same criteria. Completing the competitive review first allows you to judge your own product relative to your competition.


Preparing

Select the competition (between five and ten ofthe top competitors).
Define the assessment criteria, according to the product goals, the user types, the scope of the project, etc and write them down in a spreadsheet.
Gather your materials. Collect the competitive site URLs, software, or devices that you will be reviewing so they will be readily available. A browser with tabbed browsing works great for web reviews. 
Doing

One at a time, go down the criteria list while looking through the application and enter your responses. It can be helpful to use a double screen with the application on one view and the spreadsheet on the other. Take your time and try to be as observant as possible; you are looking for both good and bad points to report.
As you review, write down notes on what you liked, what annoyed you and any interesting widgets you see. Take screen captures of interesting or relevant screens as you do each review.
Processing results

Create an outline of the review. Paste the assessment results and your notes from the spreadsheet as a starting point for writing the report. Summarize your Insights.

When selecting a list of competitors, instead of just asking, who does what we do? Think about user"s alternatives. Ask, who or what is mostly likely to keep users from using our software or going to our website? While not normally thought of as "competition", alternatives for an operations support system could be an excel spreadsheet or printed paper forms.
You can also conduct a comparative analysis - the review of applications or website that are not in direct competition with the product, but may have similar processes or interface elements that are worth reviewing.

Rich context

What

Rich context is a technique that helps you to understand the connections between the longer term trends, the current practices of the system to deal with them and the emerging niche ways of doing things differently.

Why

The purpose of a rich context is to build a common and visual understanding of the existing and emerging paradigms on the issue or purpose and to identify the (emerging) actors and other stakeholders for your actors map.

How

In group you create a preliminary mental model about the current situation.


Preparing

Add the participants to do some desk research upfront the about longer term trends, the current practices and the emerging niche see also (http://www.iftf.org/home/)

Doing

Write the issue/intended system purpose you want to address at the top
On post-its, sketch the longer term trends (one topic per post-it). Cluster them on the center of the poster.
Examples are: Climate change, population increase, ageing, raw resources depletion"¦
Now identify what currently manages or governs them, such as like cultural and social norms, practices, rules, infrastructure, existing networks and power relations and again sketch them. Place them around the center.
Examples are: fossil fuel infrastructure, technologies, powerful energy, companies, EU-energy policy, Low level of awareness"¦
Draw the connections between the regime elements and the longer term trends. Identify the most important regime elements (the most connected).
Identify niche projects that manage the development in a novel way. Note/draw them at the outside.
Processing results

Use your rich context as input for the actors map, by which you identify whom to interview.
It is important to be aware of the dominant regime around your project: regime can support or be a barrier for your innovation. In the second case, regime change/or finding a profitable sub regime is part of the innovation challenge.
You can also use the rich paradigm picture technique to summarize and communicate your findings from the field studies.

Context map

What

Contextmapping is just what it says it is: making a map of the context (of use).

Why

Context mapping is especially useful in the exploration phase of a project. It gives you insights in the context of your issue and the underlying needs of your customers.

How

Preparing

Make large labels of general categories. These are typically the 5 Ws+H: Who, Where, What, When, Why + How or the stakeholders (users, employees, organizations etc.), the places, the products, services and activities, the moments of use, the goals and the activities involved.
Doing

Write the elements of the first 4 Ws on post-its (one element per post-it) and place them around the category labels.
In the who, identify the key stakeholders and define for each of them why and how they actually use or offer the product or service. You can use the human drive cards to find the underlying drives and needs.
Draw lines between the elements that are exchanging a value. Describe the values the elements bring each other. Think about different kind of values: emotional, economical, social, ...
Processing results

Use VUE or Kumu if you need to make a visual representation of the workshop results or if you want to elaborate furher - https://vue.tufts.edu/download/index.cfm, https://kumo.io

Make a way to distinguish different kind of content. In example, you can code it using different colours or symbols. Make an index " a field where you describe the coding of the different elements.
Use lego and tinkering material if your client is open to it.

Product-service promise

What

The product-service promise is a tool to define what you want to achieve with your future solution.

Why

The purpose of product promise exercise is to elucidate the goal of the project starting from the actual pain points of the product or service.

How

You can use this tool in two phases: in the framing phase to understand the initial question and in the reframing phase* to define the design challenge.


Preparing

Collect the "as is" pain points. Ask the participants to prepare a list of pain points up front and make a list yourself from what you learned in the field study - if the tool is used in the reframing phase.

Doing

Start by defining what the seven most important values are of your organisation. 
Note on the poster.
Ask the participants to write on post-its (individually) what the pain points are today. Ask them to use one post-it per pain points. Then, let them share their insights with the group. You, as moderator, are clustering the post-its on the poster.
Next ask the participants, in small groups, to think about how these pain-points could be addressed by design. This can be a mix of solution ideas and requirements. Again let them write their ideas on post-its, let them share, cluster.
Now, define with the whole group what will happen if you get this right (example: less strikes) and how you can measure this.
Finally, write down what the KPI are and how you can measure them.
Processing results

Make a report of this exercise in a vision and scope document and make sure this document is read by the project team and the decision makers.
As the product promise tool starts from the actual pain points it is not fit for completely new products or services. In that case the "as is pain points" layer should be changed to "needs and drives of the target group"
You can also use this tool in the reframing step.

Causal map

What

The causal map is a tool to find the underlying causes of a problem.

Why

To solve a problem, factors causing the problem must be first recognized and understood. The purpose of causaml mapping is to find the root causes of the problem The aim is to determine how to keep the problem from ever occurring again by designing prevention that recognizes and eliminates the root cause.

Actor mapping is related to, but fundamentally distinct from, traditional stakeholder analysis. Stakeholder analysis is "a process of systematically gathering and analyzing qualitative information to determine whose interests should be taken into account when developing and/or implementing a policy or program." Stakeholder analysis seeks to assess individuals" or groups" ability to influence specific projects, policies, or outcomes.

By contrast, actor mapping explores the relationships and connections among actors, as well as their relationships to a given issue, project, or intended outcome. In addition, we avoid using the word "stakeholder" because some actors that may not have a "stake" in a particular initiative or outcomes may still wield influence over the initiative or be influenced by it.

Stakeholders map

What

The stakeholders map is tool for identifying the individuals or groups whose interests should be taken into account when developing and/or implementing your product, service or system.

Why

The purpose of stakeholders map is to reveal who is involved in a given network, how they are linked, how influential they are and which goals they have. The goal of these analyses is typically to produce a prioritized list of key individuals or groups to target as part of an action plan.

How

The map is built through the observation of the system from a specific point of view that becomes the centre of the whole representation; for example if the selected subject is the user, the map will show all the stakeholders starting from their relations with him.


Preparing

Make sure you have a full inventory of all stakeholders involved (from the context map or make a list together with the participents).
Write each stakeholder"s name on a seperate post-its so that you can move and cluster.
Decide on the central actor (point of view).

Doing

Write in the inner circle who the major stakeholder is and what his/her major goal(s) are.
In the circle around (secondary), on post-its map out the actors, being the stakeholders that are directly involved in the achievement of the goals and interacting with the major stakeholder (for ex. parents, friends, service providers, .... if the end user is in the middle)
In the tertiary circle, you mention the stakeholders that are not directly interacting with the major stakeholder but are somewhere involved (for ex. managers, cleaners, suppliers...), influencing (for ex. policy makers) or have an interest (for ex. shareholders).
Reposition the post-its according to their influence on the system (you can also do this directly in the previous steps).
Draw the relations between the stakeholders and indicate what flows through the system - for for ex. money, motivation, ....
Processing results

Use VUE or Kumu if you need to make a visual representation of the workshop results or if you want to elaborate furher - https://vue.tufts.edu/download/index.cfm, https://kumu.io

You can also use this tool during the user interview. Ask the interviewee to draw the stakeholder map from his/her point of view.
You can also use this template to map only the actors - this is then called an actors map.

Background image: abcA23 - Description

Actors mapping versus stakeholders mapping
In stakeholders mapping you want to identify who has a stake in the system, which can also include individuals or organisation that are not engaged in activities with others but have a stake in the successful outcome of the project. (e.g. the bank who provides the loan or passive shareholders).

In actor mapping you focus on the individuals, organisation, and non-human actors that interact with the system. Especially non-human may not have a "stake" in a particular initiative or outcomes but can influence the system or be influenced by it (e.g. smart products or the weather).

Actors map

What

An actors map is a tool to identify and represent the key players (organization/individuals/non human agents) in the systems and their mutual relations with regard to the issue or intended outcome.

Why

In the understanding phase, you make an actors map to identify and select who you want to observe and/or interview in your field study. In the explore phase, the purpose of actor mapping is to identify opportunities to improve a system"s overall performance by, for example, strengthening weak connections or filling gaps in the system.

How


Preparing

Try to find input from evaluations and studies. Make sure to invite the right actors at the table (requisite variety!).
Identify an initial set of key actors - Optional: Populate the draft frame with key actors

Doing

Fame the system: decide on the core point of view (e.g. users). Then define the sub-systems influence the core (e.g. service providers, governance, ...)
Populate the map with the actors you identified in your preparation and specify their roles.
From these actors, brainstorm additional relevant actors and roles using the category prompts.
Map the relationships between the actors and assess the quality of the relations (normal/functional; strong/emotional; unbalanced/oscillating; conflicting; broken or ad hoc; emergent.
Mark the groups of actors with same interests and the groups with conflicting interests.
Discuss who you want to interview based on the level impact from the system, the level of engagement in the system, and the level of influence to change the system.

For each actors group, define about 5 profile to interview during your field study. Use the actor dimensions tool for this. Also for each of the actor groups or for each profile if necessary, formulate some hypotheses about the relationships and the activities involved.
You might refine and revise your actors map after the field study and use it as an input to discuss intervention strategies.
If needed, you can create separate maps on sub-topics and/or different levels of detail to reduce complexity.

S.W.O.T. analysis

What

A S.W.O.T analysis or Strengths- Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats analysis is a method to analyze the strengths and weaknesses, opportunities and threats for your organization and service.

Why

The purpose of a S.W.O.T. analysis is to sharpen the scope and objective of the project by identifying the internal and external factors that are favorable and unfavorable to achieve that objective.

How

Introduction (optional)


Preparing

No preparation needed

Doing

Ask the participants to write the internal strengths and weaknesses of your organization on post-its. Collect the post-its, stick them on the poster and take the time to rank them. Place the best strengths and the worst weaknesses at the top. Strengths and weaknesses are internal factors that create value or (on the contrary) destroy value. These factors may be resources, knowledge and skills, attitudes, location, brand image, etc.
Now consider the opportunities and threats. Those are external factors over which you as an organization have no control, but which affects your service. Examples include demographic trends, the political climate, economic factors, available technologies, and other services in the neighbourhood.
Investigate how your strengths came about, how to retain them, and how to raise all the departments in your organization to the same strong level. Examine the weaknesses and find out how to improve them.
Although you may have no control over the opportunities and threats, you can still respond to them. For example, how do you couple the population ageing trend with the rapid development of mobile communication?
Processing results

Formulate your top findings in a 'how can we' sentence. Let these sentences inspire your client personas and design challenges.
A S.W.OT. analysis can also be be carried out for a company, place, industry, or person.

Vision & Scope

What

Vision & Scope is a tool that sets the rough boundaries of the project (scope), as well as the desired state the project is working to achieve.

Why

The purpose of the vision and scope document is to explain to all parties involved what the motivation is for the project, what you want to achieve, and how you want to achieve it.

How


Doing

Stick the template on the wall and ask the participants to brainstorm on each category of the canvas. Make sure markers and sticky notes are at hand.
Fill the canvas with the sticky notes, following the suggested order:
Users: who you are addressing with your project;
Goals: the objectives you want to achieve as a team;
Team: the network of actors involved in the project, along with their roles/responsibilities;
Benefits: the positive effects of the project on your users and on your team as well;
Values: the belief system which determines cohesion in your team;
Resources: the physical/intangible assets you need for the project;
Norms: the rules you establish within your team, as well as the norms that influence the execution of the project;
Project timeline: the roadmap on which you define the milestones of the project, and the activities they consist of;
Strenghts/Weaknesses: your know-how that supports you in leading the project, as well as the competences you miss, the external factors that represent an obstacle.
Processing results

Once your canvas is complete, you can digitalize and keep it as a reference point to create convergence among all your team members.

Brand Promise

What

The Brand Promise is a tool that allows to shape and clarify vision and mission, by exploring how the values of the organisation relate to the values perceived by the target users.

Why

You want to create convergence on the value proposition of an organisation, and its effectiveness in relationship with the target users.

How


Preparing

Print the template and stick it to the wall: make sure it is reachable to all the participants.

Doing

Fill the canvas with notes written on post-its, following the order reported on the template. Proceed step by step on the following categories:

Underlying trends: behavioral tendencies, patterns detected in actual/potential customers;
Value for customers: what the target audiences currently perceive as value;
Culture: the internal values of your organisation;
Vision statement: a synthetical inspirational sentence which expresses what you aim to be/achieve in the future (ex. 'be the most reliable organisation for patient care...');
Mission statement: a sentence which synthesises how, starting from now, you are going to achieve this future ('...encouraging prevention/providing high quality professional expertise...');
Activities: how, concretely, you want to pursue your vision (ex. fostering selection of the personnel, reinforcing communication with patients, reinforcing measures for prevention)
Emotional impact: how the customers will feel as a consequence of your activities (ex. protected, relieved, safe, under control...)
Processing results

After filling the canvas, the participants should agree on the causes that drive the project, as well as the common objective they want to achieve. By examining the internal and external values, all the parts can reflect on the potential benefits for the customers.
To formulate your vision statement, try to be on an abstract level, and do not be afraid of being too ambitious: it is the expression of the ideal state.

Stakeholders dimensions

What

Stakeholder dimensions are the set of user characteristics that will influence your future solution.

Why

During the field study"in the next step"you want to understand the most different and extreme needs and expectations of the stakeholders. You have to identify these first in order to select the extreme users* to interview.

How

You do this exercise several times, once for each stakeholders group you want to interview (users, service providers, decision makers, etc.).


Preparing

Look at your context map and identify the stakeholders that you want to interview. Include at least the people who are affected by the system most, and who are influencing other stakeholders most (look at relations that are substantially reinforcing).

Doing

Decide on the most important opposing characteristics that are relevant for your project. Examples are differences in character traits, motivation, knowledge, experience, attitude, standards, context, etc. Cluster and select those differences that have the most influence on the experience of the service and set them out horizontally.
Determine realistic combinations of characteristics that together could constitute a stakeholder and link these vertically.
Repeat this until you end up with Â± 6 profiles per group of stakeholders. Determine combinations until each extreme is included at least one time.
Processing results

Find people who match the profiles as close as possible and make an appointment to interview them.
Add, after the interviews, the relevant dimensions to your persona"s.
Make sure to take differences in perspective (or world view) into account if you are dealing with systemic issues.
You want to speak with and observe extreme users because their needs are amplified and their work-arounds are often more notable. This helps you pull out meaningful needs that may not pop when engaging with the middle of the bell curve. However, the needs that are uncovered through extreme users are often also needs of a wider population. (d-school)

Human drives

What

Human drives are the underlying reasons or foundations on which thought processes, decisions and actions are based. Although we think that decision making depends strongly on functional benefits, it all comes down to one question: how will this make me feel? (source Admap).

Why

The human drives cards are a design tool that stimulate you to think about your users" motivations and empathise with them. This leads to a more human-centered view of design. The focus is no longer purely on creating products or services, but more on designing "solutions" that correspond to these drives.

How

This set of human drive cards helps you to prepare, carry out and interpret your user reseach and is a source of inspiration for ideation and co-design sessions. The cards can also help to find the emotional requirements from the design challenge.


Using the cards to prepare the user research

Start from the persona"s you defined with the stakeholders dimensions tool.
Choose the drives for each persona that you think is closest to what motivates him or her.
Formulate questions to verify your assumptions.
Using the cards during the user research

Ask your interviewee to select the drives that matter for him or her in the context of the project.
Let the interviewee explain his/her choice and ask several times why to reach the heart of the matter.
Using the cards to interpret the user research

Select the drives that came up during the interviews.
Use them as a a set of factors in the "factors & themes" exercise.
Using the cards to ideate and co-design

When using the lotus blossom, the cards can help you to understand what makes the examples work well.
In general, you can use the card to enrich your ideas.
Use the map on the next page if you don"t have the cards with you.

Research questions

What

Research questions are clear and concise questions to guide your interviews. There are two categories of questions: hypotheses to verify your assumptions and open questions about what you don"t know.

Why

Thinking about your questions upfront helps you to better understand what you are looking for and to prepare the questions you want to ask during the interviews.

How

Preparing

Deepen your understanding of the experience for each of the stakeholder types you identified by googling video testimonials, psychological and sociological studies on the topic.

Doing

Start from the stakeholder dimensions and defne which stakeholder groups (extreme peronas if you have more time) you want to interview.
Set out what you currently understand about the experience. This can be about the experience during a whole lifetime or during a particular event. First list the phases or activities your stakeholder goes through (before, during and after), then draw the experience curve. Finally look at the highs and lows and think about the reasons behind them.
Write down what you don"t understand in the experience. You absolutely want to to find this out during the interviews. These questions typically involve motivations, emotions and triggers behind the changes in the curve. Use the human drives map to help you with this.
Formulate questions to verify your assumptions and write down additional questions about what you don"t know yet. Use these questions to guide your interview but don"t hold on to them. Leave room for spontaneous directions during the interview to allow serendipity.
Processing results

List your research questions.
Ask your client or a specialised firm to find stakeholders that match as close as possible the personas you defined with the stakeholder dimensions tool. Six persons per stakeholdersgroup are sufficient if they match the dimensions well.
Look back at your system map to find your hypotheses. Look at relations between the variables - you assume that they influence each other - and pay special attention to potential intervention points.

Experience interview

What

Experience interviews are a way to understand the current experience of the stakeholders within the actual product, service or system. You want to find out about current experiences, the different steps in the experience, needs, motives, emotional feelings, underlying drives and fears.

Why

Ultimately, you want to find patterns and underlying drives. Based on these, you can draw a framework for the further development. You gather insights by talking with your target users about the current context of your future product-service experience. You also want to check if your assumptions (hypotheses) are correct.

How
This is a face-to-face interview with one interviewee at a time. Try to conduct it in the context of your issue (look at the most important places on the context map). It is good to do the interview with two persons, so one can do the talking and the other can observe and take notes. Record the interview with permission of the interviewee if you are alone.


Preparing

Make appointments with your stakeholders (users, service providers, ...).
Doing

Ask the interviewee to tell you about their experience (with your product or service of in the context of), from start to finish. This can be about the experience during a whole lifetime or during a particular event. Note down the various steps. Don"t start with the experience itself but rather with what happened just before it. Write down for each step which touchpoint is used (website, other person, building, object, etc.). Ask what happens after use also.
Specify the user experience at every moment together with the interviewee: Which activities were conducted? What was the trigger? What was the objective? How positive or negative was the experience? What was the main feeling at each step? Let the stakeholder draw the experience by means of a curve.
Once you have detailed the experience, take a look at the most extreme moments (positive or negative). Ask why this was such a positive or negative experience. Ask several times (why), this is how you reach the heart of the matter. Write the underlying reasons down on the template so that your interviewee can read them and react on them.
Processing results

Summarize your extreme insights into personas. Use all your insight to find the patterns and themes that can lead to the design challenge.

Interview tips

Listen on two different levels: you must listen to what the participant is actually saying and you must read between the lines to hear the inner voice or "les non-dit" of what the participant is communicating.
Questions should be designed to elicit an individual"s experiences and understanding. Asking about a specific experience ("Can you tell me about the last time you went to the football club?") rather than a general topic ("What do you find it to be like when you go to the football club?") is usually more likely to generate specific, informative responses. The following two types of questions can be useful for directing the interview.
"What do you mean by"¦ ?"
"Can you tell me more about "¦ ?"
"What happened then?"
"Can you give me an example?"
"You mentioned that"¦"

Questions should be broad and open-ended, rather than tailored for a specific type of answer.
Avoid questions that can be answered with "yes" or "no".
Do not share your hypotheses.
Do not use emotional, loaded or biased language. Ask questions neutrally; don"t steer to an answer. Ask "how do you feel in this situation", instead of "aren"t you afraid in a situation like this".

Consider what your behaviour conveys to participants (e.g., expressing surprise, jumping to take notes).
Do not interrupt: Participants should feel comfortable and respected throughout the entire interview"interviewers should avoid interrupting participants whenever possible.
Capture the exact words and expressions people are using, this enriches your language around the challenge and they often entail inspirational perspectives.

Observation

What

Observation is a technique that helps you to understand the people involved in your product-service system by observing their behaviour, interactions and body language.

Why

The purpose of observation is to find opportunities for improvement by identifying the patterns of use. You are especially interested in the moments of flow, the hurdles and the unintended behaviours.

How

Go to the different locations where the product-service is experienced. Observe the people, film or photograph the situation as discretely as possible. You might need to ask permission first.


Preparing

Select a number of places where you can observe people in the context of use. Choose places that are as different as possible from each other (e.g. a waiting room in a regular doctor's cabinet and a waiting room in a hospital emergency unit. Also consider various observation times if this makes a difference (e.g. in the day-time/at night).
Doing

Observe the people and give special attention to:

Manifestations of flow: moments in which the observed are captured by the experiences. They are fully engaged, or concentrated, or laughing, ...
Expressions of displeasure: moments in which the observed clearly express frustration or discontentment.
Unintended behaviours or ways of interacting: moments in which the observed act in a way that is not meant to - e.g. sitting on the back of a chair.

Processing results

Look back at at your material (pictures, movies, notes) and ask yourself what's happening and why. Pay attention to details such as cheat sheets, stuff used in combination, clothing, or other people involved.

Combine the most interesting observations into a design documentary or a phot slideshow.

Observation and interviews are two different complementary techniques. They are often used in combination: after a period of observation approach a few people and ask questions about what you observed. You can also ask questions about the purpose of use, the steps they have taken before, and what their next steps will be. 
Do not ask what they think of the product-service as it is now, but why they want to use it. Try to find out what the underlying objectives and motives are by asking several times for the reason why.
Understand // User insight

The AEIOU Framework

AEIOU is a heuristic to help interpret observations gathered by ethnographic practice. During field observation, use the AEIOU framework as a lens to observe the surrounding environment.

AEIOU stands for 5 elements to be coded: Activity, Environment, Interaction, Object, and User.

Activity

Activities are goal-directed sets of actions"paths towards things people want to accomplish. What are the modes people work in, and the specific activities and processes they go through?

Environment

Environments include the entire arena where activities take place. What is the character and function of the space overall, of each individual's spaces, and of shared spaces?

Interaction

Interactions are between a person and someone or something else; they are the building blocks of activities. What is the nature of routine and special interactions between people, between people and objects in their environment, and across distances?

Object

Objects are building blocks of the environment, key elements sometimes put to complex or unintended uses (thus changing their function, meaning and context). What are the objects and devices people have in their environments and how do they relate to their activities?

User

Users are the people whose behaviors, preferences, and needs are being observed. Who is there? What are their roles and relationships? What are their values and prejudices?

The AEIOU framework was originated in 1991 at Doblin (an innovation firm - www.doblin.com) by Rick Robinson, Ilya Prokopoff, John Cain, and Julie Pokorny.

"One of our principal analytic frameworks for looking at and understanding a situation is the AEIOU framework. What is important is not only understanding and describing each element of the framework, but also understanding the interactions between the elements." [E-Lab 1997]

Perspective interview

What

A perspective or world view can be defined as how one sees life and the world at large. It is the interpretive lens through which people make sense of life and comprehend the world around them. Sometimes the lens brings clarity, other times it distorts reality.

Why

You want to capture the perspective of your stakeholder towards the problematic situation in order to design upon these perspectives or to change them.

How

This is a face-to-face interview with one interviewee at a time. Try to conduct it in the context of your issue (look at the most important places on the context map). It is good to do the interview with two persons, so one can do the talking and the other can observe and take notes. Record the interview with permission of the interviewee if you are alone.


Preparing

Make appointments with your stakeholders (users, service providers, ...).

Doing

Ask the interviewee to choose a colour, material and shape that represents the issue for him or her. Ask her to think out loud while doing this.
Next, ask to explain why she made this choice and repeatedly (3 times) ask why until you grasp the underlying reason.
Processing results

After the interview, use the model of universal human values (Schwartz" model) to interpret the answers. People tend to pick the corresponding colours, shapes and materials if they agree with the value (behind your problem, issue or solution) and name the opposites when they disagree.
Erich your persona"s with the perscpectives.
Understand // User insights

Interpreting the answers

People"s choices of colours, shapes and materials seem to be connected with these values - see figure.

The defining goals linked to them are:

Self-direction: independent thought and action"choosing, creating, exploring
Stimulation: excitement, novelty, and challenge in life
Hedonism: pleasure or sensuous gratification for oneself
Achievement: personal success through demonstrating competence according to social standards
Power: social status and prestige, control or dominance over people and resources
Security: safety, harmony, and stability of society, of relationships, and of self
Conformity: restraint of actions, inclinations, and impulses likely to upset or harm others and violate social expectations or norms
Tradition: respect, commitment, and acceptance of the customs and ideas that one"s culture or religion provides
Benevolence: preserving and enhancing the welfare of those with whom one is in frequent personal contact (the in-group)
Universalism: understanding, appreciation, tolerance, and protection for the welfare of all people and for nature
The psychologist Shalom Schwartz has elaborated a widely accepted value model that consists of

10 human value types.

These are ordered along two major dimensions:

openness to change

vs. conservation and

self-enhancement

vs. self-transcendence.

Systemic interview

What

Systemic interviews are a way to understand the viewpoint and interactions of the actors in the system.

Why

The purpose of a systemic interview is to find out the actor's paradigm (goal, perspective, drives), his relationships within the system, the activities involved and especially the positive and negative influencers on the interaction experience.
How

This is a face-to-face interview with one interviewee at a time. Try to conduct it in the context of your issue (look at the most important places on the context map). It is good to do the interview with two persons, so one can do the talking and the other can observe and take notes. Record the interview with permission of the interviewee if you are alone.

Preparing

Make appointments with your the key actors - defined with the actors map.

Doing

Start by asking the interviewee to describe the current system using a (dynamic) metaphor. Ask to explain why. Next, ask to come up with a metaphor for the ideaal system. Again ask why.
E.g. the education system is like a swamp because you have to wade your way through it. Ideally it would be a grassland because...
Let the actor make a drawing (curve) of the experience with the system over time. Ask him to indentify the main events and to describe who was involved. Zoom in on the peaks and valleys of the curve and ask what influenced the upturns and downturns.
Now zoom in on the other actors involded. Ask the interviewee to make a drawing of the relations betweem himself and the other actors in the system and let him elaborate on each relation: what is the quality of the relation?, what are the typical activities involved?, how did the relation changed over time? What is the goald of the other? Optionally, ask what he knows or thinks about the relations between the other actors.
Use the human drives to elaborate on the needs, values and drives that influences his motivation in the system.
Finally, use the pardox card to discuss the shifts that are needed in the system.
Processing results

Summarize your insights into agonists.
Use the perspective interview method if it is difficult for the interviewee to come up with a metaphor out of the blue.

Top tasks survey

What

The top task survey is technique (developed by Gerry McGovern) to identify the "long neck" of a site or intranet, i.e. a small number of tasks that account for a disproportionately large percentage of visits.

see http://alistapart.com/article/what-really-matters-focusing-on-top-tasks

Why

Evidence over opinion! Focus on what really matters (the top tasks) and defocus on what matters less (the tiny tasks). Top tasks are the small set of tasks (usually less than 10, often less than five) that matter most to your customers. Make these tasks work well, and you"ll be on the right track. Get them wrong, and chances are you"ll lose the customer.

The purpose of Top Tasks Management is to reduce complexity by identifying what really matters to customers.


Preparing (task identification process)

Comprehensively engage the organization in a process of gathering customer tasks. (find these task in customer feedback, stakeholder reviews, benchmarking, (social) media, site statistics, search analysis"¦).
Work with key stakeholders to come up with a shortlist of these tasks.

Doing (conducting the survey)

Long version: do the survey as Gerry McGovern describes it:

Prepare the survey and come up with a shortlist of tasks (as described above).
Conduct a top task survey and get a representative sample of customers to vote (score 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 point to the 5 top tasks).
Create a league table of tasks from the one with the highest vote to the one with the lowest vote.
Short version: do a simple survey in which you ask why people are (now) coming to the site/intranet for. You will need to standardize the results of this open-ended question afterwards.

Processing results

(Short version:) Standardize the results.
Create a league table of tasks from the one with the highest vote to the one with the lowest vote.

Cultural probe

What

Cultural probes (or "diary studies") are a way of gathering information about people and their activities. Unlike direct observation (like usability testing or traditional field studies), the technique allows users to self-report. With minimal intrusion, insights into participants" environments are gleaned to identify problem statements or uncover new opportunities.

Why

You need to gather information from a group of users with minimal influence on their actions. Or you want to gather information over a wide range of time, in case the process or event you are exploring takes place intermittently or over a long period.

How


Doing

Set the goals you want to achieve with the probe (what actions or behaviors do you want to study?);
Set a series of tasks your users must accomplish every day, and the time range of the study;
Define a toolkit package that must be proveided to your selected users. The composition of this "toolbox" varies according to the kind of observation you need to lead. You might include, for example, an instant camera, a notebook/diary, pens, or also postcards/templates/activity sheets that you specifically prepare beforehand. In this case, think about the typology of information you want to extract (feelings, statements, time, mood...), and study layouts that let the users respond in the way they like to.
Recruit a certain number of users you want to involve in your study, take an appointment with them;
Provide the toolbox to your users, give them all the necessary information. Make sure they have a telephone number they can refer themselves to, in case support or further explanations are needed. If the tasks and the modalities of the study are clear, the user can start to use the toolbox in their everyday life, for the established period of time.
Processing results

Once the insights have been registered by the users in the established time range, they can be collected and filtered by the design team to extract the needed information.

Personas

What
A persona is a way to model, summarize and communicate research about people who have been observed or researched in some way. A persona is depicted as a specific person but is not a real individual; rather, it is synthesized from observations of many people.

Why

Each persona represents a significant portion of people in the real world and enables the designer to focus on a manageable and memorable cast of characters, instead of focusing on thousands of individuals. Personas aid designers to create different designs for different kinds of people and to design for a specific somebody, rather than a generic everybody.

Personas are also useful to communicate your user insights to team members that were not involved in the field study or to clients and stakeholders that you want to involve in future workshops.

How
Make a at least persona for each of your extreme users. Depending of the scope of the project you can also make personas for the other stakeholder group.

Preparing

Find portrait of your stakeholders on the internet - avoid "clichÃ©s" - and print them on A6 format.

Doing

Choose a portrait and give your persona a name. Indicate the stakeholder type.
Describe who your persona is in the context of the product or service use: occupation, environment, typical activities, stress situations, ... Add other information such as demographics or hobbies if pertinent. Limit yourself to what is relevant to the project.
Refine the stakeholder dimensions based on your user insights: list the characteristics you indicated with the dimensions tool. Refine with additional insights from the interviews.
Describe and draw the experience of your persona in the context of the product-service system. What are their immediate and long-term objectives, both rational as well as emotional? What is their attitude towards the issue? Build on the insight you captured during the interviews and the themes you defined.
Add a quote that summarizes the attitude or feeling of your persona towards your product or service.
Summarize the most important needs with key words.
Processing results

Make a delivery from your personas using Adobe illustrator or InDesign.
Don"t make too many personas, 4 to 6 personas per stakeholder group is more than enough. It is most important to capture the differences towards the issue.

Actants

What

The actants* tool is a way to model, summarize and communicate your systemic user research. It differs from personas by putting the focus on the archetypical relationships in which the actors are engaged and not on the individual needs.

Why

The purpose of the actants tool is to understand the quality of the relation and to identify the variables that are influencing the relationship in a positive or negative way.

How

You make an actants for each (important) relation you identfied with the actors map.


Preparing

Look back at your actors map and interview notes and identify which relationships are most relevant to investigate in the workshop (key users, most suprising insights, ...).
Provide prints of your actors map. Let the participants indicate the relationship they are working on.
Doing

Name the roles of each of the actors (e.g. child, teacher) and describe their drives (underlying goals) in the context of the issue and the relationship.
e.g. obesity - possible drives of mothers (overfeeding, serving convenience food): care, ambition to realise herself / for the child belonging and selfishness
Draw the nature of the relationship with a line. Use different line types to indicate the quality of the relation (see legend).
Describe the activities between the actors in the middle.
Aurond, describe the exchanges (gives and takes) that are taking place.
Clarify the influencers: all external factors that are influencing the relationship.
Finally, describe the output or result of the relationship that has an influence on the other actors in the system.
For the influencers and outputs, think in term of system variables, mark with a +/- weither it is a enabler or disabler.
Processing results

Make a delivery from your agonists using Adobe illustrator or InDesign.
Use the drives, gives & takes as input for the system map.
You can use the actor zoo cards to assess your actors based on their objectives and current position in the system.
* In The Politics of Nature Latour gives a succinct definition of what an actant is: "actants are anything that ""¦modif[ies] other actors through a series of"¦" actions (75).

Actor archetypes

What

Actors Zoo is a card set describing archetypes of actors as animals. The archetypes are based on different variations of five key dimensions met in Stakeholder Management literature. These dimensions are: Power; Legitimacy; Urgency; Interest; and Dynamism (see also the definitions in the reference folder).

Why

Use the card set to quickly identify the types of actors that are involved in the issue under examination during the Understand phase or to brainstorm about involvement strategies during the Explore phase.

How

Typically, these dimensions are examined using matrixes of Power X Interest, Power X Dynamism, Power X Urgency X Legitimacy. The matrixes result in different categorisations of actors or stakeholders and for each type different recommendations about stakeholder engagement are provided. However, there is no tool in stakeholder management that harvests the combination of different categories and working with the matrixes requires a level of familiarity with the suggested terminology. Using the animal metaphor creates a colloquial vocabulary that participants can use to examine typical actor characteristics, regardless of their knowledge about the stakeholder management assessment frameworks.


Preparing

Print the actor zoo cards

Doing

After having created your actor"s map, discuss each actor individually in terms of the five dimensions and select the equivalent animal that fits to each actor.
You can also use this tool during the explore phase: 
For the selected actors, discuss the changes in the dimensions of the actors that need to occur for the success of the project and ideate on ways to achieve them. Metaphorically speaking, the challenge would be to transform the animals into other animals. For example, a fly with power becomes a shark.

Interaction diagram

What

A interaction diagram is a tool for understanding the interaction between the control room and its adjacent centers.

Why

An interaction diagram helps you understand how information flows in the control room and its perimeter. It helps you understand what the ties between the different units in the control room are and how the control room ties in with other functional items.

An interaction diagram gives an overview of how often and through what medium the units communicate. This gives you a first fysical representation of the constraints and opportunities of a layout.

An interaction diagram is also used to create a shared understanding among key stakeholders regarding the relationship between the control room and other units.

How

Draw the relations between the units of the control room and specify what is exchanged.

Preparing

Together with your clent, you first agree on the scope of the project. As a rule of thumb, this at least one circle larger than the control room. "¨

Doing

Agree on the scope of the project. As a rule of thumb, this at least one circle larger than the control room.
Draw the relations between the units of the control room and specify what is exchanged.
Identify the different layers (control room -> supporting activities -> internal partners -> external partners)
Identify all functional units for each layer and the relations between these units and the control room. Don"t forget the feedback loops.
Draw the relations between all elements on the functional model or make a new interaction diagram and specify what is exchanged (e.g. money, information, motivation, ...). "¨
Define the nature of the relationships. Think about the 5 Ws (Who, Where, What, When, Why) or in other words: Who says what to whom? How? How often? What is the aim of this information?

Functional model

What

A functional model is is a technique for analysing and mapping out a structure of a control room. It is an abstract model that displays the different aims of the control room, which actors are involved and how these aims are related. This is typically the final step of the analysis phase.

Why

A functional model is used to map the control room functions to physical components, to guarantee that all necessary components are listed and that no unnecessary components are requested. Functional analysis is useful in projects where you are looking to change the control room lay-out or surrounding displays, or any supporting product or service.

How


Preparing

Doing

Define what the control room does: what is the object of control and what has to be achieved by this object? Determine if the control room has any other secondary functions and also focus on what they have to do in various circumstances. A function is most often a verb-noun combination. Beware to list functions (What do they have to do), not tasks (how do they do it)
Describe the characteristics of the functions of the control room.
Objects on which they apply
Tempo of activities
Locality
Any other peculiarities
List the agents responsible of the functions, both human operators (human agents) and equipment (machine agents). Group them in their functional cell.
Map the information flows between the functions: what functions are related to each other? Is the relationship mutually dependant?
Structure this information in a map
putting functions in a chronological order
connecting inputs and outputs of flows between functions (matter, energy and information flows)
hierarchy (main functions, sub-functions, etc.).

Task analysis

What

A task analysis is a systematic description of all the tasks one or more users perform in the context of use a a product or service.

Why

The things people do with the information and objects that are part of a product or service determine which types of tools and workspaces are required. Understanding the tasks that people need to perform is essential to designing a useful product or service, i.e. one that serves the goals of the user in using the product or service in the first place.

How

Preparing

You first need to get an overview of what types of activities there are and what"s involved in each. To get this overview, ask your interviewees in the field study to give you an overview of the tasks they do on a typical day, and then ask for the less frequent tasks (weekly, monthly, etc.).

Doing

Represent the overview of tasks that you got from the field study interviews in a hierarchical task structure, with subtasks (task steps) at the second and third levels of the hierarchy.
For each of the main tasks in the overview, try to understand why the task even exists. What goal is the task supposed to help achieve? And do the subtasks serve well in achieving that goal? If not, the task itself may need to be redesigned, so that it can be adjusted in the product or service.
Make sure that you describe the tasks (how they are done, and in what sequence) in the same way that your interviewees describe them. If any particular mental models play a role in how users do the task, try to make them explicit in a conceptual model.
For each of the main tasks, make sure you get a good view on its frequency and priority.
If the tasks are performed in a current product or service, make suer to get a clear understanding of how this is done.
If the tasks are performed in relationship to other people, make sure to describe what roles these other people play in the process.
Processing results

Result, steps, ...
During the field study, make sure to pay particular attention to any clear frustrations that users express with the current way of working, and/or any workarounds that they have designed themselves. Very often these will point you to a clear design challenge/opportunity.

Top task analysis

What

Top tasks are the reason why a user visits your website. Typically, for less than 10 reasons, often less than 5. 

Why

Top tasks help you to focus on what really matters to your users. Finding out why your users visit your website will help you design a clear path towards these goals, structure the content infunction of the goals and select the appropriate navigation.

How

Preparing

Make a long list of potential tasks the user could be pursuing. Start by looking at what is already there. This could come from a number of sources such as the current content (inventory), strategy documents with desired offerings, customer feedback, competitor analyses, site analytics data, task focused interviews of stakeholders.
Shorten the list to no more than100 tasks, by eliminating everything that is not a real task, such as provider centered and target specific terminology, descriptions of goals, and overlaps.
Doing

Set up a survey, in which you ask your users to select which tasks that apply to them. 
You can do this in two ways (or combined)
Open questions without predefined answer. The benefit is that you don"t influence the user in picking an answer that might not be on top of their mind when they visit the site. The downsides of this technique are that you might miss answers that seem so natural to the user that they don"t mention it anymore and comparing results across users becomes increasingly difficult.
Closed questions with predefined answers. The benefit is that the users will consider the task before selecting it. The downside of this technique is that the user might select more tasks that they actually need, just because they are there. Another risk is that you miss a top task, because it simply wasn"t in the list of responses.
Once the users selected the tasks that apply to them, let them rank their selected answers, so the hierarchies between the tasks can become clear.
If you suspect different types of users will have vastly different tasks, it might be useful to ask some profiling questions at the end of the survey.
Processing results

Start with a simple frequency analysis. Give a weight to the tasks according to the place they were ranked. Use a cumulative bar chart or a pie chart.
If you chose to segment your audience, you can combine the ordinal ranking information with the segmented data using cross tabulation in statistical software or the built in survey analysis tool.
Verify during the test phase.

Semiotic square

What

The semiotic square, also known as the Greimas square, is the elementary structure of signification.

a tool used in structural analysis of the relationships between semiotic signs through the opposition of concepts, such as feminine-masculine or beautiful-ugly, and of extending the relevant ontology.

Why

The purpose of the semiotic square is to map all the logical possibilities of characters' statements, or to analyze the relationship between characters*.

How

The square is formed by an initial binary relationship between two oppositive signs. S1 is considered to be the positive pole and S2 is the negative pole in the binary pair. All the other terms will be generated from this couple, in a relation of contradiction and implication.

Semiotic square

 

1.

The square is formed by an initial binary relationship between two oppositive signs. S1 is considered to be the positive pole and S2 is the negative pole in the binary pair. All the other terms will be generated from this couple, in a relation of contradiction and implication.

2.

HOW TO BUID THE SEMIOTIC SQUARE OF GREIMAS?

To build it we need to start from an oppositive couple. What is the theme we are detecting?

In the example I detected the theme of the travel in Odyssey, I changed the terms but they have the same relations of contrariety, contradictory and implication. Bear in mind that the scheme is not only for 4 characters, if you need there are not only 4 poles there are the spaces betwen the poles. You can arrange all the Odyssey's characters. (the scheme is also called butterfly scheme as if you were drawing a stylized butterfly).



Variation1

The semiotic square used to map the evolution of a character

Think about Dracula: he passed from an "alive" status to a "dead" status (when a vampire bites him), to a "not dead" status when he became a vampire.

Variation1

The semiotic square used to analyse values

This is Floch's Semiotic square, introduced by Jean-Marie Floch to analyze values in advertising, according to consumers.

The model is really adaptable because it displays a map of all the possible values.

Reframing is one of the key skills of a designer. It is a key element in the front end of any innovation process, to look at a problem and to position the problem, situation, or opportunity in a way that the result is actionable.

System map

What

A system map is a technique for visualising the system, its structure and the interrelations between the elements of the system.

Why

You make a system map to discover the leverage points in the system. Besides this, a systems map is also a useful tool for developing a shared understanding between the stakeholders about the complexity of the system and the interdependences and causal relationships between the variables.

How

Preparation/Preliminary steps

If you work for a client, you first agree on the boundaries of the system. As a rule of thumb, this is one level above control of the client.

Doing

First decide if you want solve the issue (or unwanted result) of the current system or instead rethink the whole system by rephrasing its purposeo.
Start drawing your map by defining the core of the system.
When you work from the issue, first identify the core dynamics or loops. it helps to use a metaphor to define them. Also see if you can identify one or more system archetypes in the core. Identify the core variables in the loops and build the engine on the map.
Identify the core activities or the "raison d"Ãªtre" of your ideal system if you work with the purpose. Again, identify the core variables and build the engine on the map.
Now define what variables influence the core. They are typically related to 7 domains: ecological, institutional, economic, social, psychological, cultural and manufactured.
Draw the relations between all elements on the map. Mark relations that are substantially reinforcing and indicate if they reÃ¯nforce each other in the same (S) or opposite (O) direction. If applicable, indicate delays in the system.
Identifying the leverage points - hese are the nodes with the highest number of connections between them and most connections to the core. If you can change them, you will most probably have an impact on the system.
Processing results

Use VUE or Kumu if you need to make a visual representation of the workshop results or if you want to elaborate furher - https://vue.tufts.edu/download/index.cfm, https://kumu.io

System maps are built out of variables - these are the elements of the system that vary over time. Make sure not to mix them up with static elements as this will not lead adequately to the leverages.
Use nouns or simple noun phrases. One way to test if you have a variable is to place the words "Level of "¦" at the beginning of it. State the variables as neutral as possible and do not use qualifiers such as "increasing" or "decreasing".

Action system map

What

An action system map is a variant of the generic system map. The action system is a way to build the system map from the actants.

Why

For non-system thinkers making a system map is a very tough task. The action system map tool provides a guided way of doing this.

How

The poster tool is designed to work on one set of actants per group of participants. Use the Design Studio wall of you want to look at all the actants together during the workshop (this is more systemic but much more time intensive).

Doing

Variables - qualify the drives, gives and takes of your actants to make it clear what you exactly mean. E.g. not just 'care' but 'quality of care' or 'amount of care'; not just 'time' but 'quantity of time', not just 'affection' but 'level of affection'. Write the variables separately on small post-its so you can move them around.
Core relationship - start from the most relevant or suprising drive of one of the actors. Identify the give and take variables that are linked to this drive and mark the relations. Indicate how the drive, gives and takes reinforce each other (in the same (S) or opposite (O) direction).
Next, add the most important drive from the other actor. Here too, add at the variables and indicate the nature of the relationship.
Add the other relevant drives one by one, then add the other agonists one by one.
Influencers - add variables that influence the core relationship. Start from the influencers of your agonists and add others inspired by the following domains: Economy; Manufactured; Social; Psychological; Institutional; Cultural; Ecological.
Identify the leverage points - these are the nodes with the highest number of connections between them and most connections to the core.

Story Loops system map

What

Story loops is a tool for detecting and mapping the system which underlies a story told by an actor, in order to explore possible needed interventions.

Why

You want to understand the causes which underlie the behaviour of your actor, by discovering the system dynamics in which it is rooted, and evaluating what has to be changed.

How

Preparation

Take an appointment with the actor you want to interview. Make sure you are equipped to record the session.

Doing

Sense a system in the story: listen to your interviewee. Does he talk about continuous uneffective interventions? Does he refer to problems that seem to be cronic? Does he mention situations that are escalating? If so, it is likely that he unconsciously refers to a systemic problem.
Listen to the story: let the interviewee talk and try to distinguish between the "actual story" and the "aspirational" one, namely a description of a desired state. Give priority to the first one.
Listen to the story again, with "variable ears": now listen to the recorded interview and try to identify the "variables", nouns which designate things that increase or decrease over time. You can draw hints from sentences as "this goes up/down".
Transcribe these words as pronounced by the interviewee on large post-its that you will place in a flipchart.
Be more precise and correct the words. Be "tight": you have to express a measurable quantity. Be "right": you have to express exactly what the actor meant. Be "neutral": the language should describe the variables objectively.
Create links: Work with your interviewees, and ask them to link the variables described. The arrows should describe a growth in the same (S) or opposite (O) direction. If they are able to create loops, it means the map is correct.
Identify the reinforcing or balancing structures (loops marked by growth in same or different directions). You might identify system archetypes or, if not, recognize where the pattern of the system needs to be changed in order to pursue the desired state.
Plan your needed interventions by adding links, breaking links, reducing delays.
Processing results

Use Kumu to make a visual representation of your system map (https://kumu.io).

Once you identify what corrections you need to introduce in your system map on paper, you can help yourself with Intervention Strategy to understand where you can intervene...in reality.

3.

Ask to draw links among the variables. Use arrows marked by (S) or (O) to describe reinforcing or balancing structures.

4.

Now observe your map and discuss what you need to change in the represented pattern: adding links, breaking links, reducing delays.

System archetypes

What

The systems archetypes describe common patterns of relationships among the elements of the system that appear quite often. The archetype cards are a diagnostic tool to provide insight into the underlying structures from which typical behaviours emerges. 

Why

The System Archetypes are highly effective tools for gaining insight into patterns of behavior. They help to see the circular feedback structures that are producing the problematic behaviours you are trying to solve.

How

Archetypes help you to answer the question, "Why do we keep seeing the same problems recur over time?"


Preparing

Start by familiarize yourself with the archetypes by studying the cards and by reading the paper "The System Archetypes" by William Braun.
Basically, there are only four generic archetypes:
Underachievement, where intended achievement fails to be realised,
Out of Control, where intended control fails to be realised,
Relative achievement, where achievement is only gained at the expense of another,
Relative control, where control is only gained at the expense of others.
Doing

Start from the issues you defined in the system map. Next, find the leverage points that relate the most to the issue. Look at the most important leverage points first (most relations/closest to the core).
Use the cards, one by one and discuss with the participants in the workshop which (if any) are relevant to their context. Indicate the loops on the systems map. Don't worry if the archetypes are overlapping or nested - this is usually the case.
Ideate on ways to modify or add to the archetype or combine archetypes, in order to adapt them to their particular conflict - the solution strategies on the cards are a good way to start with this.
Processing results

Clarify each archetypical loop and the solution to it by writing concrete storylines.
Archetypes are also useful prospectively to test whether policies and structures under consideration may be altering the organizational structure in such manner as to produce the archetypal behavior.

Factors and themes

What

Factors are the elements contributing to a particular result or situation - they are things that can increase and decrease. A themes is a common element to multiple factors that explains the phenomenon associated to the research question.

Why

You want to explore the contributing factors and find patterns and themes behind them. This will help you to create a response to the problematic situation

How

Introduction (optional)


Preparing

Look back at your desk research and interview notes and identify what factors are key "enablers" of the issue (e.g. what enforces the quality of the experience) and what factors are key "inhibitors" or things that negatively affect the issue (e.g. what reduces quality of the experience). Pay special attention to:
Repetition: topics that occur and reoccur; Indigenous typologies: languages that characterizes the experience of a group such as jargon and slang.; Metaphors and Analogies: figures of speech; Similarities and Differences; Missing data: topics that are either intentionally or unintentionally avoide; Perspectices on the topic and on others; the shifts in the conversation (they othen start with key factors).
Doing

Write the factors on post-it"s. Make sure to use one post-it per factor as you want to move them around and cluster.
Cluster all factors on a wall. Typical clusters are the main tasks and activities; the needs, motivations and drive; underlying causes; feelings, fears and perspectives; economic, societal and technological developments (e.g. aging population, personal robots) and trends (e.g. self-monitoring) in the context of the topic. Spot and indicate if there is a hierarchy within each of the clusters (something can be a sub-factor of something else) and put these post-its together.
Look at all the factors and draw the relations between them (also between clusters). Identify the most influencing factors. These are the factors with the most relationships. Identify the themes behind them, these are
Processing results

Make a mind map of your findings, using for example google drive mindmup.

Value proposition

What

The value proposition is a tool to make your value proposition explicit and to agree on how to make value for people, organisations and society at the same time, as well as from the perspectives of economics, psychology, sociology and ecology.

Why

You want your innovations to be as meaningful as possible, by preparing your workshop participants to generate ideas that bring benefits to all the involved stakeholders.

See also references: Value Framework, Elke den Ouden.

How

The tool can intervene in different moments of the design process. Once the values (potential benefits) for the target users are clear, you want your stakeholders to understand the benefits for the other levels: organisation, ecosytem and society as a whole. (e.g. the core values of the organisation, the shared values of the business ecosystem, the value for society as a whole). You can use the tool after factors & themes, where you understood the values for the users, or between the system map and intervention strategy, to make sure the stakeholders embrace collective benefits when planning areas of interventions/ ideating.

Preparing

Use the standard template reporting the dimensions identified by E. den Ouden. You may want to adapt it with the dimensions that are relevant for your project (e.g. "medical" in place of "ecologic").

Doing

Stick the template to the wall and look at the themes/leverage areas from the previous phase. Identify the values for the user in the four dimensions (economic, psychological..), write them on post-its and stick them in the center of the poster.
E.g. Rethinking the Sydney Opera House podium on inhabiting public space lead to these three themes/values""liveliness/rejuvenation," "spiritual uplift," and "the sense of place/home"" (Frame innovation, Kees Dorst)
The model of Elke den Ouden helps to identify their position on the poster. "The sense of place/home" is on the user/sociology level, "spiritual uplift is on the user/psychology level).
Now look at the other levels, and identify the potential benefits that you want to achieve for the single organisations, the ecosystem of organisations, and society as well.
Processing results

Use the values to define your design challenges (they are the whats and whys) and in the ideation steps to validate if your ideas and solutions are solving the issue in a way that brings value to all stakeholders.

An important feature of values is that they always hang in the balance, they are neither good nor bad; and in the context of the problem situation, they are not the problem nor the solution. They just are. And they are universal, in the sense that they belong to the existential condition of all human beings. They are deeply personal on the user level.
Understand // Reframing

Value proposition, instructions

 
 
1.

Identify the values (benefits) for the users in the four categories (e.g. economic, ecological, psychological, social). Help yourself with the model from E. den Ouden.

2.

Write the values for the users on post-its, that you will stick in the center of the poster.

3.

Now identify the benefits you expect to achieve for the single organisation: stick the post-its in the correct position according to the four categories.

4.

Repeat the exercise for the ecosystem of organisations and society as well.

Rich picture

What

A rich picture is a pictorial, cartoon-like representation of everything you discovered up to know. They were initially developed as part of Peter Checkland"s Soft Systems Methodology.

Why

You want to present your analysis to the client or you want to inspire the design team that will work on the solution. You can also make the picture in a workshop with your client and stakeholders to encourage discussion, interaction, and to attain a holistic understanding of the issue.

How


Preparing

Make a mindmap or other annotation of what you understand today.
Doing

There is not one particular way to make rich pictures but if you don"t know where to begin, the following sequence may help to get you started:

Look for the elements of structure in the situation (these are the parts of the situation that change relatively slowly over time and that are relatively stable; the main stakeholders, the places, the hierarchy and the dependencies).
Next, you look for elements of process within the situation (these are the things that are in a state of change: the activities that are going on).
Then look for the ways in which the structure and the processes interact. Doing this will give you an idea of the climate of the situation. That is, the ways in which the structure and the processes relate to each other.
Within the situation, look at the social roles that are regarded as meaningful by those involved, and look at the kinds of behaviour expected from people in those roles. If you see any conflicts, indicate them.
Based on the guidelines of http://www.sysweb.open.ac.uk

Processing results

Make an infographic of your rich picture if you have to present your findings to a large group or to convice the stakeholders about the problems and opportunities.
You can also use this technique in the framing phase; to depict the problem.
Avoid conclusions or directions towards solutions. 
Note: It can also be useful to update your system map after this stage.

Design challenge

What

A design challenge is a (re-)formulation of your problem based on all the insights that you gathered. You decide where you want to focus, and you formulate what you wish to design in a single, clear sentence.

Why

You want to define and explore the problem(s) or challenge(s) to solve in the next phases an find the most important requirements.

How

Introduction (optional)


Preparing

Make sure you have processed your desk research and user insights. Make a presentation of them if you want to use this tool in a workshop with participants that were not involved in the research.

Doing

Phrase your design challenge(s) as following: How can we obtain this result [what], for these persons [who], to achieve this long time goal [why]. For example: How can we help vulnerable young people to find a job to make them participate into society? Write the "what", "who" and "why" in the middle of a large sheet of paper.
Define the emotional (soft) and rational (hard) requirements or objectives that must be met. These design requirements will be different for each problematic situation and can derive from both users and other stakeholder groups.

It helps to start from the "how", "what", "who" and "why" to find the requirements.
"How" requirements are all the objectives with regard to the way persons will interact with the system (e.g. it should be possible to interact on the move).
"What" requirements are all the objectives with regard to the immediate result you want to achieve (e.g. the job must fit with the cultural values of the employee).
"Who" requirements are objectives related to the characteristics of the persons involved (e.g. also for people with a mental handicap).
"Why" requirements are long-term objectives (e.g. the solution should include a growth path).
Processing results

Look for inspiring examples that meet your requirements.
Use the paradoxes of the next step to find and sharpen your requirements.

Design challenge, systemic

What

The system design challenge tool helps you to (re-)formulation where you want to focus, and what you wish to solve in the next "explore" phase.

Why

You want to define the problem(s) or challenge(s) to solve in the next phases based on the (idealised) goals of your personas and to iscover where there is most opportunities for innovation 
How

First you define the challenge and requirements from the view point of each personas, next you enrich each challenge


Preparing

Make sure you have defined who your main stakeholders or personas are and how they relate to each other. You can use the stakeholders map for this preparation.
Decide from which persona's point of view you are defining the challenges in the workshop. You can for example only look at the end users during the workshop and add the requirements of the organisation later on.

Doing

Write the persona name at the top of the poster.

Define what you want to solve with your perona. Phrase this as a design challenge: Usually it"s in this order: How can we help the persona to do/achieve what, with who (or with what if smart things are involved) to achieve this long term objective (why).
For example (persona home care provider): How can we help to improve skills through P2P interaction so that he/she can become an expert and a coach for the others?
Write the "what", "with who" and "why" in the boxes in the middle of the poster.

For each type of requirement, define the requirements or objectives that must be met:
Service requirements - related to the tasks and other activities.
Product requirement - related to the (future) objects involved in the activities
Interpersonal interaction requirements - related to the interacting with the other persons involved.
Contextual requirements - related to the (indirect) interaction with the larger context.
Emotional requirement - related to the non-functional goals of your user?
Rational requirement - related to the functional goals of your user?
Processing results

Refine the requirements and complement with the requirements from other stakeholders. Take the results with you to the ideation and system scenarios workshop.

Mind mapping

What

Mind mapping is a technique to jointly set up a classification (site taxonomy or tree structure, lists of metadata or facets, "¦) with content experts, using a mind-mapping document visible to all (projection).

Why

A mind map is the perfect tool for organising information in a direct manner. You can create the structure live in front of the workshop participants, as the discussion unfolds. A mind map is also very flexible and easy to manipulate. By creating a classification together with content experts and stakeholders in a workshop, you are building consensus.

How

Preparing

Have the content inventory of the current site ready/available in the mind map. Use the inventory only as a checklist towards the end of the mind mapping exercise, to make sure you have included all important content items in your new classification.
Prepare lists of items which are already known and pretty much fixed (e.g. list of available products, list of locations) and have these ready/available in the mind map as well.
Doing

Start from an empty mind map.
First, list (content) items that should be on the site or intranet. After a while, start grouping items that belong together and give group labels.
Move nodes around, rearrange, change labels etc. as much as needed, until you reach the point that everyone mostly agrees on the result.
Do multiple workshops when you are making the classification of larger sites or intranets. Make a report after each workshop and sent the report to all participants, so they can review the classification afterwards.
Processing results

After the workshop, check for spelling mistakes and inconsistencies, without changing anything fundamentally to the classification, and make a report in MS Word with the result of the exercise (use "paste as bitmap").
Document the rationale behind the classification, and include the rationale in the final workshop report.
As a moderator of this exercise, you stay in full control of the mind map at all times. Don't let participants take over the screen at any point. But on the other hand, don't ignore comments of participants either. If someone suggests a change to the classification, don't be afraid to try it out in the mind map. It will be easier to discuss the idea/suggestion when you see it in front of you.
A second person can write down comments and discussion points during the workshop. This will help you document the rationale behind the classification.

Card sorting

What

Card sorting is a classification method/technique for understanding how people think about the content and categories of a site, intranet or application. In a card sorting session, you let users sort a series of cards, each labelled with a piece of content or functionality, into groups that make sense to them.

Why

The technique of sorting physical index cards is simple, effective, hands on and intuitive. As card sorting is done with end-users, you will learn the users' logic and point of view, instead of the logic of stakeholders/content experts.

How

You write pieces of content (things/topics/"¦) or functionality down on index cards (or the software equivalent, e.g. OptimalSort). During the session, you ask people first to sort the cards into groups that make sense to them, then you ask them to give a label to each group.


Preparing

Make a list of content labels, functionality labels or both. Select content that can be grouped at the same level (cf. fruit vs. jonagold apple) and that participants understand. Print the labels on cards and number them - one label per card. Provide empty cards.
Recruit participants (end-users that are familiar with the content).
Doing

Use an intro script to introduce the activity
Hand out cards and materials (after the introduction, not before!)
Ask the participants to sort the cards (while thinking out loud)
Ask participants to label the card groups (using post-its)
Ask follow-up questions (overall rationale? Best examples for each group? Is the team happy with the overall outcome?)
Record the outcome (write card numbers on the post-it of the card group they belong to)
Processing results

Enter the raw results/data in the Excel template and standardize the card group labels.
Analyse the results - the cards, groups, labels, comments:
Groups: what cards were put into a specific group
Cards: in which groups was a card sorted
Card group labels: similarities and differences in terminology? Formality of language? Organizational schemes (by topic, by audience"¦)?
Integrate the results of all session in your classification, but know that card sorting never results in a complete and finalized classification for a site, intranet or application.
Have 2 or 3 participants per session (to promote discussion). When individual, ask to think out loud. Have several sessions per card deck!

Container model

What

Xxx is a method for identifying the content of your website and the links between content. It distinguishes content elements from objects, xxx which makes this e great method for cross-linking between pages. This method makes you think in building blocks of a webpage rather than full-pages, doing so speeds up the design process and makes it easier to adapt when necessary.

Why

This tool is especially useful for websites or applications with a lot of related content in which contextual navigation might be the main navigational pattern. The tool helps you to prioritise content, and thinking in containers makes it easier to design responsive websites and applications. The container model makes your website or application easy to update since the containers can be modified without affecting the rest of the content.

How

Introduction (optional)


Preparing

Step
Step
Step

Doing

Start by identifying the main objects (eg: products, location, brand, "¦.).
For each object identify the content, content elements are core content like images and text and metadata.
Next, for each of the objects think about what other objects could be linked to this object, these are nested objects: they will be "nested" into another object.
Prioritise the content elements and nested objects
Add the call to actions where deemed necessary
Group the content elements and nested objects into containers. Containers are blocks of information that are autonomous, their order does not matter (within a block?), containers can come from different (external) sources.

A.D.P.T. ideation cards

What

The A.D.P.T. ideation cards is a tool to find solution ideas for your systemic challenges.

Why

The purpose of A.D.P.T. ideation cards is to inspire the participants of the workshop by providing them with a random selected set of four different cards: activities, drives, purposes and (mega)trends.

How


Preparing


Make a copy of the generic cards in the postersAndOtherTools folder and adapt in function of your project:

Report the drives and (mega) trends that are relevant for your project.
For the activities, use generic customer journey activities or customize the activities according to your project.
For the purpose, make custom cards (from the point of view of the organisation, eco-system and society).

Doing

Appoint a facilitator/note taker in each team.
Select an activity card, and ideate three rounds for this activity: for each round, pick three cards from the other decks (1 purpose, 1 drive, 1 trend) and come up with ideas. If you feel stuck, feel free to pick another purpose, drive or trend card. For each activity, you should come up with 3 ideas.
Bring the ideas together into solution concept elements, that you will quickly write/draw in the Idea cards.
Pick another activity card and repeat the exercise.
Processing results

Select the best ideas using the impact poster or the touchpoint matrix. Next combine the concepts into scenarios or customer journeys.
Add benefit/value cards if appropriate.
Phase // Category

A.D.P.T. cards, instructions

 
1.

Intervention strategy

What

The intervention strategy template is a tool to help you to understand and explore how (on which levels) you can intervene in the system.

Why

There are multiple ways to intervene in a system and a solution should always be a combination of interventions. The intervention strategy template helps you to see the spectrum of possibilities in a workshop together with your client and stakeholders.

How

Look at your themes through the lens of Donella Meadows" insights to define the scope of your design interventions and find solution ideas on a strategic level.


Preparing

Start by familiarize yourself with the intervention levels by reading the paper "Leverage Points: places to Intervene in a System." by Donella H. Meadows.
Doing

Look back at the leverage points you defined in the system map.
Combine them in into meaningfull groups and brainstorm about the themes behind them. You can use the human drive cards to help you with this.
Place the themes inside the wheel by answering the questions under each intervention level. Write the answers on post-it - use post-its of different colors per theme. Themes can be repeated over the intervention levels.
Ideate on ways (what if questions) to modify the current approaches. Bear in mind that they should lead to an adequate outcome or benefit for all stakeholders/actors.
Decide together with your client which interventions you take along based (... TBD) on feasibility, impact and momentum or power/knowledge).
Processing results

Explore value propositions by writing concrete storylines (or what if scenarios). 'What if the 'initial problem' is approached as if it is a problem of 'theme x'.
"Know that once you intervene at a certain level, all levels below will tend to change."
"As an example, let"s say a bus driver has a goal (3) "to be on time", if you change that goal to be "great customer service". Bus drivers will modify their behaviour to meet that changed goal. They may wait for a slowly walking elderly passenger to get to the bus rather than close the doors and leave. If goals such as this change, the levels below, for example, the information flows (6), and rules (5), must also change, you must now measure great customer experience, rather than just if the bus is running on time." 
(Source: Tim Tompson)

Paradox cards

What

The paradox cards stimulate paradoxical thinking: the process of consciously bringing together the paradoxical sides of a problematic situation to achieve solutions for the whole. It is about AND thinking instead of OR thinking.

Why

Paradoxical thinking generates unusual viewpoints, leading to a better and broader understanding of the true nature of a particular problematic situation or opportunity. It is especially useful whan (re)designing systems as there are often multiple perspectives at stake, The idea is to find a solution that suits all.

How


Preparing

If you have time you can make tailor-made paradox cards for your project.
Select some cards upfront if you want the perticipants to work on specific topics.
Doing

Look back at the system map, the themes, the design challenge and the requirements and spot the paradoxes: the situations that seem contradictory or conflicting.
Ideate on the extremes " separately or directly combined. Avoid solutions that are a compromise of the "extreme" ideas.
Combine the solutions for both extremes into your concept.
Processing results

Combine the solutions for both extremes into your concept.
For non designers or beginning designers it is better to first ideate on the extremes separately.
Use the map on the next page if you don"t have the cards with you.

Paradoxical ideation

What

Paradoxical ideation is the process of consciously bringing together the paradoxical sides of a problematic situation to achieve solutions for the whole. It is about AND thinking instead of OR thinking.

Why

Paradoxical ideation generates unusual viewpoints, leading to a better and broader understanding of the true nature of a particular problematic situation or opportunity. It is especially useful when (re)designing systems as there are often multiple perspectives at stake, The idea is to find a solution that suits all.

How

Use the paradox cards to help you with this.


Preparing

Look back at the system map and your value proposition and spot the paradoxes. Usually, these are the paradoxes in which today one of the extremes is dominant (and in some way blocking the system, e.g. top-down vs. bottom-up) and the paradoxes that are emerging from your to be value proposition (e.g. shared vs. private).
Make a short list before the workshop.
Doing

Let the participants choose the 2 sets of paradoxes that will make the most difference to the future system if you can solve them both.
Adapt the paradox definitions in function of your project and write the definitions on the axes on the poster.
Look at each quadrant separately and ideate on solutions that address both paradox extremes. For example: what could be the solution if it has to be shared and bottom-up?
Look at all your ideas and investigate if they not exclude each other. If so, adapt your solutions.
Finally explore how your ideas connect to each other and how they can reinforce each other.
Repeat the exercise with a different pardox card set.
Processing results

Select the most mature ideas using the capacity tool. List the best ideas an use them in the next scenario and concept exercises.
You can also use this tool to find strategies for triggering the change in the system by starting from the most dominant sides of the paradoxes and then think about strategies to move towards the mixed intended states (see also Ezio Manzini).

Lotus blossom

What

The lotus blossom is a creativity technique for finding ideas by means of lateral thinking. The original version of this brainstorming technique was invented by Yasuo Matsumura, a management consultant from Japan.

Why

This technique stimulates the participants to find inspiration by looking at how others fulfil the requirements. It is especially useful when you brainstorm with people that are not used to thinking out-of-the-box.

How


Preparing

Gather inspiration from state-of-the-art examples from other domains or from your domain. You can find inspiration on http://www.springwise.com, 
http://www.psfk.com, http://trendwatching.com, ...

Doing

Write the design challenge in the centre of the poster.
Look at the design requirements you defined earlier. Pick the eight requirements that will make a difference if you solve them right (they are most problematic or differentiating from existing offerings). Place them around the design challenge.
Find an inspiring example for each requirement. These examples may come from a completely different context and may even be very personal such as "your mom" if the requirement is about caring. Write the inspiring examples in the boxes further away from the cluster in the centre.
For each of the examples, think about what makes it perform that well. Place the eight main characteristics of each example in the circles around the box.
Combine the characteristics into solution ideas.
Processing results

Prioritize your ideas using the COCD box. Sketch out the best ideas and bring them with you in the next exploration phases.
Use the paradox cards and/or human drives cards to understand what makes the examples work well.

Meta-examples

What

Meta-examples in design are inspiring examples from other domains, cultures and systems (e.g. nature).

Why

Meta-examples help designers to understand unfamiliar design problems and to find solution ideas by juxtaposing them with known situations.

How


Preparing

Look back at to your themes and challenges and find an inspiring example that addresses this well. For example, if you want to redesign the experience in a concert hall for contemporary music you could take the music festival Tomorrowland as a meta-example. Another meta-example could be religious places and the rituals and religious objects involved;
Make a visual presentation or moodboards to convey the different aspects of the examples to the participants of the workshop.

Doing

Present the meta-examples to the participants of the workshop.
Look back at your challenge and requirements and investigate how your example is dealing with each requirement. For example, if your requirement is "exchanging contact information" you could find inspiration from the Smart Bracelets that allow festival goers to trade Facebook contact information with a tap of a button.
In small groups, describe (or sketch) how the insprational ideas can be applied to address your requirements.
Processing results

Prioritize your ideas using the COCD box. Sketch out the best ideas and bring them with you in the next exploration phases.
You can also make a second moodboard of all the ways your requirements are addressed by the example system and use it as a visual reminder during the following steps. Combine visuals with words that describe the values.

Meta-examples, case

In his book "Frame Innovation", Kees Dorst describes a case study in which designers from the Designing Out Crime centre are looking for a solution for the late-night alcohol-related violence in the streets of Kings Cross in Sydney (case 8).

The designers quickly reframed the issues that were presented to them by the local council as law-and-order problems, and looked instead at how this area could be decriminalized. They used the metaphor of a well-run music festival to find solutions.

The proposed solution is a way-finding system combining temporary signage and street wardens to help (alcohol-affected) patrons navigate their way around and away from Kings Cross.

Large, bright-coloured signs providing information on way-finding, public amenities and transport could be affixed to the footpath at key points to provide clear directions for (alcohol-affected) patrons.

In addition, street wardens in casual yet clearly visible uniforms could be engaged on a voluntary basis to answer questions and provide information to patrons in a friendly and personable way. These measures help to guide and control the flow of people during peak times.

Business ideation canvas

What

The PSS busineshs Ideation canvas is a tool to incorporate business model thinking for IoT in the ideation pase.

Why

In the ideation fase you should not only look at the user experience but also at ways to create value for your client. The purpose of PSS business Ideation canvas is to make sure that the business value emerges from your concept instead of added afterwards.

How

You ideate about ideas inspired by the inherent capacities of the architectural layers of an IoT solution.


Preparing

Together with your client, make a list of the capacities of the organisation and its eco-system (partners, ...)

Doing

Start by mapping out your opportunity space:
The drives, needs and goals of your users;
The drives, needs and goals of your client;
The key capacities of your client's organisation, its eco-systems, the context of use;
External opportunities and limitations;
Technological possibilities
Combine the above into ideas
Start from your product component, what functionalities should it offer to respond to you users' and client's needs, drives and goals?
Who else, besides your users and client, could benefit from your solution? Do they need extra functionalities?
Can you build services around your basic offering that enhances the experience, and creates value for the whole eco-system?
What can you to with the (meta)data generated and co-created by the users and the "things"?
Processing results

Elaborate the ideas and iterate on the requirements on your design challenge poster.

Idea selection matrix

What

The selection matrix is a way to select your ideas. The matrix is especially useful for looking at large numbers of ideas and assessing each idea"s relative importance.

Why

The purpose of Idea selection matrix is to select ideas based on their value for the users and for your client (or more specific: impact on the user"s lives versus feasibility for the client, or impact on all stakeholders versus economical value for the client).

How

Preparing

Make a list of selection criteria based on your themes, challenges and requirements. If some decision criteria are more important than others, review and agree on appropriate weights to assign (e.g., 1, 2, 3).
Determine the number of votes to give by each participant based on the number of ideas and participants (number of votes = number of ideas divided by number of participants).
Make a list* of all the ideas and make a print-out for each participant.

Doing

Present the axes and the list of selection criteria. Make sure everyone has a clear and common understanding of what the criteria stand for.
Let the participants vote on the ideas - let them vote individually, otherwise they will influence each other.
Write the withholded ideas on the post-its and (one idea per post-it) and cluster them on the matrix. You can use coloured round stickers to mark the different vote types.
Processing results

The ideas that score best on both axes are of course the most important ones. These should be retained.
Ideas that are ordinary for the user but very important to the client should be renewed (can we make this idea more interesting for the user?)
Ideas that have a high impact on the user but are of lesser value to the client are to be revised (can we achieve the same goal differently? For example, by involving external parties) or to be put aside for later.
When used in combination with an idea generation exercise: Let the participant write all their ideas on post-its (one idea per post-it) and put the ideas - insorted - on the wall. Let the participants vote using 3 different coloured dots.
Make the vote public if you want to influence the outcome. You or the project owner will then open the vote session.

Bodystorming

What

Bodystorming is an immersive ideation method for exploring and combining ideas through roleplay and physical interaction with props, prototypes, actual products and physical spaces.

Why

The overall goal of bodystorming is to understand the relationships between people, their physical location, and the things (e.g., tools, devices, materials) they use in the future context.

How

Get a small group together to prepare the bodystorming.

Preparing

Define the locations where a product or service will be used. Visit those locations and observe how people interact. Watch how people interact with each other and the artefacts in their environment.
Develop the prototypes and props that you need to explore an idea. You can do this on the cheap with cardboard, sketches, existing furniture, and whatever else you can find nearby.
Identify the roles that are important for understanding your product, service, or environment. Keep in mind that people may play the role of hardware or software as well as the roles of customer, user, or troubleshooter.
Doing

Role play different scenarios. Feel free to improvise and role play new situations and scenarios that emerge from your initial round of bodystorming.
Reflect on the bodystorming experience. What did you learn? What new questions emerged? You are likely to find new possibilities as well as new challenging problems.

Serious play scenarios

What

Serious play scenarios is a technique for finding concept ideas for the future user experience by thinkering (thinking and tinkering) and role playing.

Why

By role playing you"ll find ideas that you hadn"t thought of because the technique encourages you to think from a user"s standpoint and to go through all the steps.

How

Introduction (optional)


Preparing

Step
Step
Step

Doing

Look at all your ideas and create the future users" and other stakeholders" environment and artefacts from Lego, Play-doh, paper, etc.
Look back at the user types you defined with the dimensions tool and choose Lego or Playmobil figures for each user types. Add figures for the other stakeholders involved.
First list major steps the user or other stakeholders goes through. Start with the activity before the main action (e.g. noticing your offering) and stop with an activity after the usage (e.g. receiving a mail with upcoming offerings).
Role play the whole product-service from start to end. How would the characters act and react to the events if they were real user? As you play, adapt the product-service system as soon as you run into problematic situations or get new, better ideas. A nice way to do this, is letting the person who addresses the situation or has the new idea take over the Lego piece and play until someone else has a better idea. Play the whole journey the user is following when they use the product-service system, over and over again.
Processing results

Document the best parts of the scenario by taking pictures and notes (on post-its) or by drawing a storyboard.
If your issue is linked to a location it is useful to play out the scenarios on a map.

Activity playground

What

The Activity Playground is a tool for ideation: it helps you to translate solutions ideas practically, by looking at elements which are essential in the future business model.

Why

You want to engage your stakeholders in conceiving feasible solutions, by giving guidelines for an effective "serious play".

How


Preparing

Print the Activity Playground templates, making sure that each team in the workshop will have at least one poster. Set up the workshop space by preparing different "islands". Equally distribute posters, markers and tinkering material amongst the islands.


Doing

Start with the left area of the poster: what ingredients do you need for your solution?
Think about the key actors and partners: place the Lego mini-figures on the canvas. Stick a post-it with their name or role (e.g. Vanessa, mum, kid, dean, doctor, ... ) in the upper left section of the poster to make them recognisable.
Think about the physical/digital resources: place them on the lower left section of the poster. You can use tinkering material to describe them, or draw them on sticky notes.
Move to the central "playground": how do your actors and resources interact in your solution?
Place the key mini-figures and objects in the "main stage" area and start to play. Try to imagine how the various interactions between actors and resources would take place. Do not hesitate to remove/add actors and resources if needed, and write actions on post-its if it helps to explain them.
How is your solution sustained? Place in the "backstage support" the actors and related resources that are essential to sustain the solution (e.g. government by providing fundings, management by allocating time and space, ...)
Once your solution is clear, do a quick verification brainstorming in the right area of the poster.
Which benefits does your solution bring to the community?
How will you measure if your solution is successful?
How can your activity ensure self-learning and quickly adapt to possible changes?
Let the different teams present the envisioned solutions.
Processing results

Translate the solution into a story, a storyboard or a diagram. In the last case, you can bring it further by using the Activity Model tool.

Scenarios of use

What

A scenario of use is a textual description of one or more users (personas) interacting with a future product or service to achieve a clear goal. It is written in a informal, natural language, and describes the whole context of the interaction, including the situation, other actors, objects and events.

Why

Scenarios of use are the first step in imagining what the future product or service could be like. Like other stories, they help us to revive our imagination, and create and communicate new ways for personas to interact with the product or service. As such, they also help to realise the full potential of personas: without them, personas are like characters without a plot.

How

Doing

Write scenarios of use for all personas, making sure that the full scope of functionality of the future product of service is represented. Go from the more frequent, day-to-day tasks to less frequent tasks and exceptions. Do not get lost in the details of exceptional tasks, but do make sure that there is a place for them in the final concept of your design solution.
For longer scenarios, you can start by writing an outline of the most important steps of the scenario, and describe them in detail in the full story.
Write the scenarios from the point of view of the user, and exclude anything that goes on behind-the-scenes of the product or service that pulls your focus away from the user experience.
On the side of the user experience, make sure to describe the whole context of that experience, and include everything that influences it. If a user is interrupted a lot by phone calls, for example, that will probably influence your design.
Processing results

Write the scenarios in Word and let the client review them. You can also use the scenarios to check with other stakeholders if you have understood everything well, and whether a design solution is viable. If not, writing new scenarios of use is the fastest and cheapest way of exploring other possible solutions.

Find the right balance between the abstract and concrete in your writing. If the scenario is too high-level, it is more a requirement than a scenario of use. If you describe too many details (control labels, interaction details) in the scenario, there is no creative headroom left when you start drawing.
Do not forget to provide a clear end to your scenario, that concludes the original goal and motivation of the persona for performing the task.

Future scenarios

What

Future scenarios is a tool for systemic design projects that enables us to think interventions in terms of possible future contexts, generated by leverage points that express critical uncertainties. The goal is to create narrations of alternative future intervention needs, that can stand as ground for the generation of ideas. 

Why

Thinking in terms of systems means appreciating complexity but also uncertainty. It means thinking about the future in non-linear way and designing interventions that remain resilient regardless of how the system will evolve in the future.

How (see also the long description in references)

Preparing

Start by deciding together with the workshop participants about a time horizon and a geographical scope for the scenarios.
Consequently, workshop participants must work in smaller groups and select the leverage points that capture critical uncertainties for the organisation.
Define a series of overarching themes for the selected leverage points. The emerged themes are the scenario dimensions.

Doing

For each scenario dimension, define the extremes. For qualitative dimensions, use the paradox cards to ideate on multiple extremes.
The combination of extremes gives out alternative scenarios. However, a selection of scenarios must take place, according to the ones that seem more interesting. Each working group should select scenarios separately
Discuss the choices and conclude in a final selection.
For each scenario, use the value framework to stretch the meaning of the dimension extremes in different levels (user, organisation, ecosystem, society, environment)
Discuss, in group, how the extremes influence the overall system behavior. Capture the conclusions in a textual description that begins with the conditions of the future state (dimension extremes) and continues with their impact on different areas of the system map.
Processing results

After the workshop, the designers can further enrich the generated scenarios with descriptions of impact that the participants might have missed. In a following session the participants must be able to generate ideas about how to intervene in each possible future, using the intervention strategy template and cards as inspiration. 


Generate up to 3 to 4 themes. More is unmanageable since for N number of themes the number of resulting scenarios is 2N

PSS solution spaces

What

Solution spaces is an expoloration of the "playground" of your future solution. You do this by playing around with the specific characteristics regarding the PSS and its related business concept.

Why

Before you decide on your final solution, you want to create a range of different PSS scenarios and underlying business concept in a more structured way to and understand the consequence/influence of your choices on the interaction with product, service and resulting overall experience.

How

Introduction (optional)


Preparing

Look back at your defined universal themes (step 3//framing).

Doing

Explore the potential for both your users as for you client by playing around with the PSS dimensions. Start with the predefined ones and add your own (you can use the inspiration material on the top of the template for this).
Decide on 3 sets of solution approaches by connecting them vertically. Make the sets as distinct as possible.
Describe and visualize your each approach.
Evaluate each approach. Use "PSS & BC dimensions.pdf" (in reading list) to help you with this.
Now combine the best ideas of each approach into one final approach.

Touchpoint matrix

What

A touchpoint matrix is a design tool for analysing and designing the user experience based on multi-channel and cross-device platforms and services. It is invented by Gianluca Brugnoli, teacher at Politecnico di Milano and designer at Frog Design.

Why

The purpose of the touchpoint matrix is to verify and refine your PSS concepts by visualising the connections between the system and the user.

How

Introduction (optional)


Preparing

Step
Step
Step

Doing

Vertically list the different touchpoints within the scenarios you played in the previous step: artefacts (e.g. smart thermometer), digital services (e.g. diagnosis app), physical service (people - e.g. consultation) and contexts (e.g. the doctor"s office) that are part of the system.
Horizontally list the actions, intentions and values that are supported by the system itself. To find them, look back at the themes and the design challenge (objectives, goals, intentions, values). Indicate these with dots in the matrix.
Once this structure has been composed, verify it by putting a persona or stakeholder inside and imagining their journey through the different touchpoints, connecting the related dots. Use a different colour for each persona journey.
Finally, look at the whole and examine improvements:
Can you improve your touchpoints, making them contribute to more goals? (look at the blanks)
Do you need more touchpoints? (you can look at Simon Clatworthy"s touchpoint cards for inspiration)
Can you make the system simpler by reducing the touchpoints?

Narrative

What
A narrative or story is a report of connected events, actual or imaginary, presented in a sequence of written or spoken word and still or moving images.

Why

You want to present your final concept to your client and to the stakeholders.

How

Introduction (optional)


Preparing

First think about what you want your story to convey:
What do you want your viewers to take away from the presentation?
Which part of our solution do we want to emphasize?

Doing

Make a storyboard. Be aware of the story"s beginning, middle and end.
Use your personas in the story, and make new characters if necessary.
Work on your dramaturgy. Dramaturgy is the amount of intensity (excitement or tension) through the story.
Make a video (stop motion, video sketch, short movie) to present your concept.
Processing results

Result, steps, ...
Remember that all the characters in your story have skills, needs and personal goals. Include a few small but effective details in the way your characters act or look, to help the viewer"s relate to the characters and feel that they know the person. Play on stereotypes.
If it fits, add some elements of surprise the story to make it all more interesting.

Storyboard

What

The storyboard is a tool derived from the cinematographic tradition; it is the visual representation of use cases through a series of drawings or pictures, ordered in a narrative sequence.

A storyboard shows all the main interactions which occur between the user and the touchpoints of a product-service system, for a realistic representation of the future experience.

Why

You want to translate visually a future scenario, or display the main steps that define the experience of the user within a real context. You can use the storyboard before implementing your solution, to display how the user will interact with a product, with the service touchpoints, or to describe all the interactions that occur within a product-service system.

How

To draw a storyboard, you should think about capturing the experience of your users in a sequence of photograms, as it happens in cinematographic techniques or in comic strips. You can show the steps of use of a product in a defined context, as well as the fruition of a service system step by step.


Doing

Look at the overall experience of the user and define the interactions you want to represent.
Use the template, or simply take a large sheet of paper, where you will draw a sequence of squares.
Draw in each square the single steps that describe the experience of the user, adding a short description of the scene under each square.
Processing results

Use the storyboard to display how your solution will appear once implemented, and test if your story shows inconsistencies which can be solved, in order to improve the overall experience of the user.

Cores & paths

What

An IA thinking tool to identify the most important pages on a site/intranet and to detail the contents and designs of these pages. When structuring and designing your site, you start from the core (= the reason why users come to your site) and work from there (= onward paths). This technique was created and refined by Netlife Research.

(see http://alistapart.com/article/the-core-model-designing-inside-out-for-better-results)

Why

Websites or intranets must be designed from the inside out, with primary focus on the core tasks its users need to accomplish. Instead of putting all your efforts in defining the content and design of the homepage (outside in) and the overall navigation, you start from the principle that every page is a homepage. "Paths, not hierarchy. No dead ends!" (@AreGH)

How

Preparing

Reflect beforehand what could be the core of the website/intranet you are designing. You can usually derive this from the main findings in the analysis phase (user interviews, visit statistics etc.) or in the classification workshops.
Doing

Identify the core pages. Have a brief discussion with all workshop participants about what could be the core(s). Split up your workshop participants into 2 or 3 break-out groups. Decide which break-out group is going to work on which core.
Identify the user goals and list the business goals of the core. The user goals will inform the inward paths, the business goals will determine the onward paths.
Identify inward paths (what do people already know, and how do they get here?) and onward paths (What do they want to know and do next? What are the call to actions).
Define the content of the core (both essential and supplementary information): e.g. Title, abstract/intro, author, picture of the product, product category, technical specification, instructional video, etc.
Design the page (optional). Make a sketch of the core page, using the core content building blocks you have just identified and the onward paths (call to actions) you have listed.
Processing results

Report on the main results of the Cores & paths exercise to the team, e.g. by a picture report (the filled-in template and the design sketches).
Use the results from the Cores & paths exercise to design the core pages. The first step can be a thumbnail version of the core pages (in a wireflows scheme). The thumbnail design illustrates the overall structure of the core page and contains all the building blocks and call to actions you identified during the exercise. After validation of the thumbnail version of the core pages, you can make detailed wireframes of the pages.

Customer journey

What

A customer journey is an overview of the future service both from the viewpoint of your end-users and from the service providers. The journeys are looked at in time and through all the various touchpoints. You combine all the scenarios.

Why

You want to bring everything together into one complete product-service concept and eventually, present the solution to your client and to the stakeholders to discuss, improve and validate them. You can also make the customer journey in a workshop together with them.

How


Doing

Start from your scenarios and touchpoint ideas.
Use the template or take a big sheet of paper and draw 4 lanes: users actions, touchpoints, front-of-stage interactions, back-of-stage interactions and support processes.
In the first lane, horizontally write the steps of the users and the goals in each step (e.g. finding information). Start before the main action (e.g. the reason to use your PSS) and stop after the main action (e.g. relationship building).
In the second lane, draw all the touchpoints that are involved in that step.
In the lane underneath, write the activities regarding exchanges between the user and the system (e.g. registration, payment, "¦)
If you have time, make several customer journeys: short-term, mid-term and long-term.
Processing results

Make a visual delivery of your journey.
If your team needs to work online, check https://realtimeboard.com/ for a virtual brainstorming session. 
Optionally, in two additional lanes, list all the activities that should happen behind the scenes to make the front-end activities happen (e.g. control identity) and underneath the supporting processes (e.g. manage the registration database) thus transforming the customer journey into a blueprint

Swim lanes

What

Swim lanes are a tool to illustrate how processes involving multiple contributors progress through their various chronological stages, and influence each other over time.

Why

You want to visualize different processes occurring in the same time, show how they influence each other over time, highlight the tasks that each actor is supposed to accomplish for a clear distribution of responsibilities.

How

In a swimlane diagram, processes are split into distinct channels according to whose responsibility they are. The events defining the processes can be organized in sequence and connected by arrows, so multiple processes come together to form a whole.


Doing

Choose the process that you want to map and clarify the different roles that are involved.
Stick the template on the wall, or take a big sheet of paper. Draw a table: you will write the generic phases of the process on the first line, and the roles in the first column;
For each role, determine the various steps/tasks foreseen in the process and write them on post-its, that you will place in the correct line of your table. Remember to follow the language of processes (ex. draw a square around data or objects, an ellipse around activities...);
Once you have defined all the steps that occur over time, indicate with arrows and specific symbols the sequence according to which the activities take place.
Processing results

Digitalize your swim lines to have a clear presentation on how the various responsibilities within the process should be distributed over time.

Activity model

What
An activity model is a visual representation of one of your solution concepts. With the model you depict the interaction elements and actors involved and the flows/activities between them.

Why

You want to present a system solution to your client and stakeholders to discuss or to validate them. Or you want to define it in detail in a workshop, together with the client and stakeholders.

How

Preparing

The activity model is a tool to define a solution in detail, rather than a tool to ideate. That is why you need an activity model poster for each solution you identified in the previous steps. You can plan to have different teams in the workshop, and provide one poster to each of them.


Doing

Think about the actors that participate in your solution: write them down, specifying the task they need to accomplish in the activity.
Use the central space to draw the actual "activity model": describe the solution using a diagram. Map all its necessary elements, indicating how they relate to each other (the actors, their mutual relationships, the interactions with physical/digital touchpoints, other flows of physical/digital assets). Help yourself with different colors, symbols or icons, and feel free to use the language that you consider appropriate to represent the solution.
Now that your solution is drawn on paper, try to define how you will implement it step by step. In the timeline section of the template, specify all the sequential steps to make the activity run, and for each step, write/draw the context (where the activity takes place) and the resources you need (e.g. skills, money, motivation, information, ...).
Processing results

Use Visio or a free online tool such as https://www.draw.io/ to draw the final version of the engine. Add your actors and society layers using illustrator.
General tips for making a map:
Distinguish different kinds of relations. You can code using colour coding for the type of relation (material, financial, ...) and plain/dotted lines to differentiate the S and O relations.
Add a legend - a field where you describe the coding of the different elements
Establish visual hierarchy"the context of the map should be seen from across the room, the most important from two meters, and the details do not need be readable before you stand close to the map

Interventions map

What

The interventions map helps you see the connections between the to be interventions, both the designed as the non-designed ones.

Why

A systemic solution is always a combination if interventions, whereby some can be designed as activities and others are rather principles and recommendations that we as designer cannot implement (e.g. rules, bonus systems, organisation values, ...).

The purpose of the interventions map is to understand how the interventions are reinforcing one another (both in same or opposite way) and to adjust them accordingly if necessary.

How

The interventions map is a step after the activity models.


Preparing

Look back at the intervention strategy exercise and identify together with your client which (not-designed) intervention recommendations are to be taken into account.
Doing

Write all interventions around the circle, both the designed as the non-designed ones.
Draw the relationships between the interventions and see how they influence each other. Are the loops reinforcing or balancing?
Identify the nature of the reinforcing relationships. Are they reinforcing in the same or in the opposite directio?
Discuss and review conflicting interventions, if any.
Processing results

Make an infographic of your intervention circle. Make sure to make the relations between the inteventions clear.
Often the interventions map reveals a sequence between them, showing which interventions should be scheduled first.

Operational validation

What

Operational validation is is a technique to assess your to be system activity model by running operational 'what if' scenarios.

Why

You want to verify if you future system is flexible enough to cope with changes in capacity and demand.

How

You 'mentally' run what if scenarios to evaluate how operational changes may impact your activity model.


Doing

Start by reflecting on what will influence the demand of the users/customers and the capacity of your solution.
Typical cause of demand variations are: seasonal climate changes; working periods/holidays; moments in the day; accidents, crime and disasters; ...
Typical cause of capacity variations are: stock capacity; manufacturing and delivery capacity; number of employees; break downs; ...
For each of the quadrants think about "what if" scenarios related to your activity model. Identify the process elements that are at stake.
E.g. supply of primary goods, production, delivery; ...
Brainstorm to find solutions to the problems.
E.g. flexible employment; just in time supply chain; marketing strategies; ...
Processing results

Use the best solution ideas to improve your activity model.

Conceptual model

What

A conceptual model is an abstract, schematic representation of the concepts a user should understand in order to be able to interact successfully with a product, service or system.

Why

People create internal representations (mental models) to understand and predict events in the world, based on their experience, perception, and imagination. They also build these mental models for any system or product that they need to interact with. That is why, as a designer, you want to give clear clues (a clear conceptual model) to users about how a product or system works and how they can interact with it. In other words, you want to help the user in building a mental model that allows them to use the product or system successfully.

How

Preparing

To create a clear conceptual model for the future product, you need to get a good insight into the current knowledge of the user. What is their experience with current and similar products or systems? How will this be different in the future one? You gather this information in the Understand phase of the project, by interviewing users.
Doing

Identify the meaningful object types that users need to understand to be able to interact successfully with the new product or system. If these object types differ for different users, identify object types for each of them.
Also identify meaningful clusters, relationships or structures between the objects and specify them.
E.g. for an e-mail system, you would identify Messages and People, but also Conversations consisting of related messages and Collections of messages that are related in other ways
Choose the correct labels for the objects, relationships and structures, i.e. the ones that are meaningful to users, and avoid jargon and abbreviations
Identify the main interactions that users will have with the objects and structures, and think about appropriate affordances that you will need to build into them.
(Investigate if and how the concepts and interactions will evolve over time and adapt your model accordingly)
Processing results

Make a schemetic representation of your mental model.

You can test your conceptual model by playing the Chinese whispers game:
Find about five persons that have not been involved in your project. Present your conceptual model to the first player. Now ask the first player to explain the model to the second player, then ask the second player to explain the model to the third player, and so on. Ask the last player to explain the model to you. Compare your original and the final model and reflect on it. Which of the main concepts have been lost? Why? For example, your model could be too complex, not consistent or not familiar enough.

Content model

What

A content model documents the different types of content in a project. It contains detailed definitions of each content type"s elements and their relationships to each other. Its level of detail is determined by the purpose it needs to serve.

Why

A content model is a content strategy tool that translates the intentions, stakeholder needs, and functional requirements of the user experience design into a format that:

Helps information architects and designers to map the content types of the CMS correctly to the site design and vice versa;
Helps developers to configure the CMS so that it supports the design optimally;
Gives content authors guidelines for creating the content and entering it into the CMS.

Wireflow, scenario based

What

A wireflow is a set of small scale screens organised in a flowchart. The screens are drawings which contain the main components needed for that interaction without going into detail: no representative data, no graphic design. Drawings are made for each screen type and for the most important tasks a user needs to accomplish with the product.

Why

Before you move and invest in detailed design you want to be able to validate your high level concept. A wireflow defines the main structure and basic layout of each screen type and the main interaction and navigation concepts (e.g. separation of consulting and editing, wizard, feed-back). When combined with scenarios, wireflows help in storytelling the to-be experience of your design.

How


Preparing

Have your scenarios ready. Additionaly you can prepare by collecting inspiring examples.
In an information heavy site without much transactional flows, you start from the result of the cores & paths exercise; together with your client identify those page-types that you are going to embed in the wireflow.

Doing

Start by highlighting in the scenarios the events that involve important interactions with the product. in groups, each group works on one or more scenarios.
On large post-its draw low-fidelity screens for the events you marked, stick to the essential.
Bring together all the screens and identify the patterns. Make them consistent throughout the conceptual design. Write down the rationales of your decisions.
Processing results

Use a drawing or prototyping tool (Illustrator or Axure) to draw a formalized version of the wireflows. Verify the completeness by running through all the scenarios of use.
Have a review meeting with the client In a live meeting making annotations on a large-size poster works well. Make it concrete by doing a walk-through from the viewpoint of the personas.
Produce a final version. Use annotations for issues that are still under discussion.
Producing wireflows in co-design workshops is not always effective, especially when the participants are not trained in thinking about interaction elements. In that case it is recommended to produces wireflows offline and discuss them in a review meeting.
Consider making a video of the wireflow with voice-over explanation as a deliverable.

Process map

What
A process map (also called process flowchart) is a step-by-step diagram that shows the activities needed to deliver the product-service.

Why

You want to define in detail what is needed to deliver the product-service, from the business point of view. Once you map out a process, it"s much easier to explore the capacity and the limitations of the service and where there might be a problem. Identify the steps that are most time-consuming and that require a recurring investment of resources. This will allow you to clearly define the required investments and the strategy for growth of the PSS. Sit down and identify each step that your process needs to function well.

How

Introduction (optional)


Preparing

Step

Doing

Start from your blueprint and write the main steps of the process(es) on post-its.
Flowchart them in sequence as they are performed using rectangles for "tasks" and diamonds for "decisions". Use connecting arrows between boxes to represent the direction of the sequence.
Decisions often (but not always) pose questions answerable by YES or NO. It can be convenient to structure the questions so that the preferred answer is "YES" whereas "NO" leads to re-routing etc.
Useful conventions that then follow are to draw: The "YES" route out of the bottom of the diamond (i.e. normal flow downward through the chart - The "NO" route as a line out of the side of the box.
Estimate for each step what is needed to actually perform the task:
Who will carry out the task (e.g. person(s)/role(s), computer, system, ...)?
How much time will this take?
What is needed to perform the task (e.g. inputs, tools, environment, ...)?
Identify the bottlenecks, typically causes by capacity and timing issues and improve your process to solve them.

Blueprint

What

A service blueprint is an overview of the future service both from the viewpoint of your end-users and from the service providers. The journeys are looked at in time and through all the various touchpoints. You combine all the scenarios.

Why

You want to bring everything together into one complete product-service concept and eventually, present the solution to your client and to the stakeholders to discuss, improve and validate them. You can also make the blueprint in a workshop together with them.

How

Introduction (optional)


Preparing

Start from the improved version of your scenarios and touchpoint ideas.
Step
Step

Doing

Take a big sheet of paper and draw 5 lanes: users actions, touchpoints, front-of-stage interactions, back-of-stage interactions and support processes.
In the first lane, horizontally write the steps of the users and the goals in each step (e.g. finding information). Start before the main action (e.g. the reason to use your PSS) and stop after the main action (e.g. relationship building).
In the second lane, draw all the touchpoints that are involved in that step.
In the lane underneath, write the activities regarding exchanges between the user and the system (e.g. registration, payment, "¦)
In the fourth lane, write all the activities that should happen behind the scenes to make the front-end activities happen (e.g. control identity).
Finally, list the supporting processes in the last lane (e.g. manage the registration database).
If you have time, make several blueprints: short-term, mid-term and long-term.

Business model

What
A business model describes the rationale of how an organization creates, delivers, and captures value. It represents a blueprint of the enterprise"s strategy, to be implemented through organizational structures, processes and systems.

Why

Once you have defined the value of your product/service/product-service system, you want to define how you are able to translate it practically and make it tangible for your users. In the same time, you analyze not just how to produce and deliver such value, but also how it affects your organization structurally and financially.

How

To visualize a business model, you can use a general business model canvas, which is composed of nine blocks that depict your business by displaying its customers, offer, infrastructure and financial viability. The blocks contain the following elements:

Customer Segments: who are the users you are addressing?
Value Propositions: the expression of the value you produce (What are you offering to your customers? Which user problems are you solving? Or which needs are you satisfying?)
Channels: the tangible/intangible way you deliver value to your customers (how do communication, distribution, sales occur?)
Customer Relationships: how will you set up and structure the relationship with your customers?
Revenue Streams: what is the source of your incomes, once the value proposition is successfully offered to your customers?
Key Resources: what are the assets/capacity you need to produce and deliver your offering?
Key Activities: what are the activities that are necessary to produce and deliver your offering?
Key Partnerships: if you need to outsource activities or acquire resources outside the enterprise, who will be your partners?
Cost Structure: what are the costs associated to the elements in your business model?

Doing

Use the template, or take a big sheet of paper on which you will draw nine squares, following the standard layout. Fill the canvas in a brainstorming session.
Define the content of the sections through short sentences/drawings written on post-its, that you will stick in the correct area of the canvas.
Proceed in the same way for all the other boxes, filling them one by one. Follow the order displayed in the introduction.
Processing results

Make a visual delivery of your business model, selecting all the relevant elements identified during the collective session.

Phase // Category

1.

Stick the canvas on the wall, or draw the business model canvas on a large sheet of paper.

2.

If drawn, make sure the canvas contains the nine categories: customer segments, value propositions, channels, customer relationships, revenue streams, key resources, key activities, partnerships, cost structure.

3.

Start filling the categories one by one, following the order displayed in step 2. You can write short notes or draw sketches in post-its, that you will stick on the canvas.

4.

Elaborate a clear visual of your business model.

Interaction moodboard

What
Interaction moodboards are visual compositions of colours, materials, expressions,... that together convey the look and feel of your system.

Why

To ensure a coherent and consistent look and feel over all touchpoints, and to challenge your solution to the goal. The interaction moodboard inspires the design of your services and products, and in particular the look and feel of your prototyping.

How

Introduction (optional)


Preparing

Look for images of colours, materials, sounds, light, textures and expressions.

Doing

Start by collecting material to describe the Vision of your system.
Myth, Philosophy and Ritual are common for all touchpoints. Every touchpoint serves a different Purpose.
Continue by working vertically, from top to bottom, for Expression and Product. Assemble images in lanes, one for each touchpoint.
Bring everything together in one board.
Focus on Vision. Compare with your design challenge requirements for consistency. Compare with your rich picture of the as-is system for deviations. The bigger the contrast, the harder to implement your solution, the further the implementation could move in the future.
By finding patterns between the lanes, you can select the items that express the look and feel of your system. Choose striking elements from each column and rearrange them to create the interaction moodboard.

Expression describes the social setting, language and means of communication:
- Staging: Social, organisational, technical or physical context
- Course of action: Before, during and after the interaction
- Symbols: Culture-specific meaning and representation

Product describes the morphological aspects:
- Function: Practical use or purpose by design
- Affordance: Relation between actors that affords the opportunity to perform an action
- Structure: Arrangement of and relation between the parts
- Form: Particular way in which the touchpoint exists or appears
- Material: Matter and characteristics

Interaction metaphors

What

Interface metaphors is a technique to explore meaningful interaction models by tapping into the knowledge that users already have of other domains.

Why

Humans use metaphors to understand one concept in terms of another. In design you use metaphors to provie clues to the users about unfamiliar product use, thereby turning a novel interaction into a intuitive and comprehensible one.

How


Preparing

Make a list of all the system functionalities. Next identify which are novel and thus unfamiliar to your users.

E.g. you want to design a smart wearable by which you can transfer hugging on a distance.
E.g. you want to design a smart products that changes its functionality by connection modules together.
Doing

Generate possible metaphors for each of the unfamiliar funcionalities. A useful way to genarate metaphor ideas is to ask others (users) what each functionality is like.
E.g. hugging is like squeezing a pillow or hugging is like being coverd by a blanket.
E.g. connecting things is like making a puzzle or building with lego blocks.
Make sketches or prototypes of each metaphor and identify what the attributes are that call for interaction. E.g. a door/doorhandle is an iteraction clue to enter a house (metaphor).
Analyse your metaphor ideas by running task based and goal oriented scenarios.
Processing results

Use the interaction metaphor attributes to build affordance in your design.
E.g. if you want to makke the squeezing interaction explicit you can use high malleability soft materials and textures.

Wireframe

What

A wireframe is a mid-fidelity prototype of a digital interface.

Why

The purpose of a wireframe is to structure the information, define the user interactions and show the relationship between the different elements in a digital interface.

Wireframes are ideal for early testing and for collaborative conversations about the design solution. Changes can be made quickly, thus supporting an iterative way of working.

How

Wireframes can be produced by drawing on paper or by using any graphic or presentation-oriented software (Adobe Illustrator, MS Powerpoint, etc.). At Namahn, we have agreed to use Axure, a dedicated wireframing software with team working and sharing possibilities.


Preparing

Use the wireflow of the conceptual design as a starting point. Define the content and functionalities per page or screen if the wireflow is not detailed enough yet.
Think about user testing early on (making these pages first).

Doing

Start by drawing the major blocks of content/functionality and determine a layout with boxes using a grid. Keep the hierarchy of the information and user tasks in mind.
Add details to change the blocks into recognizable elements. Use basic typography (font-size) to differentiate between the different levels of information. Fine-tune with grayscale, contrast, positioning, grouping, alignment and indenting to create a visual hierarchy and flow.
Let your wireframe evolve gradually from a lo-fi prototype into a mid-fi prototype by incrementally adding more details (actual content, images, interaction). While doing so, make sure you keep your design elements consistent throughout (typography, spacing, etc.)
At the end, add a site map to give a clear overview of the wireframe content to your team members and to the client. Give each page/screen a clear name and number.
Processing results

Wireframes are used to validate the structure, hierarchy, basic visualization and most important user interactions. Test as soon as possible. If possible, present the test wireframes in the device (e.g. PC, tablet, mobile phone) they are created for.

Because wireframes do not resemble the final design, you should manage the expectations of all the team members, clients and other stakeholders well.
Refrain from adding too much graphical detail to your wireframes, as this may distract and influence the test users. If you do use color, use it intentionally.
Let other team members and stakeholders review your wireframes, iterate often and don"t get too attached to your design. Add notes while designing to improve the collaboration and sharing.

Infographic

What
Information graphics or, simply, "infographics", are visual representations of information, data or knowledge intended to present complex information quickly and clearly.

Why

You want to tell or explain a specific story, addressing yourself to a precise audience.

By utilizing graphics, you want to enhance the human visual system"s ability to see patterns and trends, thus improving the cognition about the information you need to convey.

How

To build an infographic, make sure the story you will talk about is clear to the workshop participants. To this aim, you can print it on paper, distribute it to the participants and give them the time to read the story individually or collectively. Also, make sure the "Visualization patterns" poster is clearly visible on the wall.

Doing

Define goal and target audience: what do you want to tell? To whom? Try to synthesise your message and target audience in no more than 2-3 post-its.
Recognize the "information potentials": in the text, look for words related to appeareances, quantities, relations, hierarchies, time, locations, flows. Highlight them with different colors, possibly following the ones used in the poster.
Explore the visualisation possibilities: select the highlighted elements and for each one, decide how you are going to represent it visually. Follow the hints displayed by the poster: you might represent quantities with bubble charts or dot matrix, hierarchies with tree diagrams or mindmaps, time with timelines or time circles, locations with maps and so on.
Sketch: how will you draw the selected elements? Take a large sheet of paper on which you will sketch different possibilities of representing them, then select the most effective ones to convey your message. You can draw them on post-its or separate pieces of paper.
Develop a storyline: assemble your elements on a blank sheet of paper, trying to tell a coherent story with beginning, development, end. Never forget message and audience! You will start with a catchy title, develop your story and end it with an appealing conclusion, shaped in the style of a "call to action".
Test your storyline: if you have the possibility, invite a representative from your target audience. Let your draft paper infographic talk by itself, and let your user talk about it: verify if it results clear and effective.

Step
Step

Doing

Decide about the touchpoints or solution that you want to test (critical, entirely new experience, ...)
Make a mini (table-top) or real-size prototype with low-cost materials. Emphasize on the interaction elements.
Use paper and marker to prototype your interfaces. Pop-up menus, messages, and dialogue boxes can be simulated with post-it stickers.
For 3D prototypes a lot of options are available. You can use cardboard, foam, wood, plastic, clay and building blocks.
Consider intangible touchpoints such as guidelines for employees on how they should address people or what body language they should adopt or avoid.
Look at the design with intent patterns from Dan Locktin to stimulate the right behaviour.

Me-fi prototype

What
Medium-fidelity prototypes are models of your touchpoints with enough detail to enable the testing of the main functionalities and interactions. In a medium fidelity prototype at least one or a few elements are functioning.

Why

You make medium fidelity prototypes when you know what you want to build (i.e. your system is defined) but you are still searching for the most optimal interaction design.

How


Preparing

Define which elements of your concept are crucial, you will only focus on this aspect.
Create one or several storyline(s) which you want to test.

Doing

Make your prototype appears as if it works "for real". The key is to "trick" people into thinking everything works.
Augment your prototype with some interactivity using an electronic or digital prototyping platforms. The tools you use will greatly depend on your concept.
Processing results

Test the main functionalities and interactions with users

During testing, you are ideally present to observe interactions and stakeholder reflections in detail.
After a medium fidelity testing session, you typically engage in a dialogue with your respondent to reflect upon the designed service and/or product.


Where relevant, medium fidelity prototypes are able to be changed on the fly. For examples, elements can be removed, added or changed based on stakeholder feedback or observation.

Arduino, open-source, hardware prototyping platform

https://www.arduino.cc/

Arduino is an open-source prototyping platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board. To do so you use the Arduino programming language (based on Wiring), and the Arduino Software (IDE), based on Processing.

Raspberry Pi

https://www.raspberrypi.org/
The Raspberry Pi is a low cost, credit-card sized computer that plugs into a computer monitor or TV, and uses a standard keyboard and mouse. It is a capable little device that enables people of all ages to explore computing, and to learn how to program in languages like Scratch and Python. It"s capable of doing everything you"d expect a desktop computer to do, from browsing the internet and playing high-definition video, to making spreadsheets, word-processing, and playing games.

What"s more, the Raspberry Pi has the ability to interact with the outside world, and has been used in a wide array of digital maker projects, from music machines and parent detectors to weather stations and tweeting birdhouses with infra-red cameras.

Hi-fi prototype

What
High-fidelity prototypes are detailed models of your touchpoints, with a high level of detail and functionality. They should be regarded as a final version of a prototype, this means that all aspects (user interface, interaction design and materialisation) have been defined.

Why

From a user testing point of view, a high-fidelity prototype is close enough to a final product to be able to examine usability questions in detail and make strong conclusions about how behavior will relate to use of the final product. A high fidelity prototype should allow end users to evaluate your product over time.

How

Introduction (optional)


Preparing

Consolidate findings during low and medium fidelity testing and define all aspects of a final prototype.
Ideally you make a detailled, final, system mapping using a rigid modelling language. This makes communication to external devopment or engineering parties easier.
You create a list of specification which allows you to outsource any components (soft or hardware) which you are not able to create yourself.

Style tiles

What

Style tiles are visual design artifacts that help to define, together with the client, the visual language of a website/mobile interface. By identifying colors, imagery, typography, they establish a direct connection with actual interface elements, without defining the interface layout.

Why

You want to translate, together with the clients, their brand identity into concrete visual elements that will characterise their whole web system.

How


Preparing

Listen. Plan a meeting with the clients and organise a brainstorming session on the PSS goals (convince, raise awareness, relax, push action, ... ), metaphors ("if your PSS were a ... what would it be?"), attributes for the ideal website (engaging, vibrant, compelling, ... ). You can use paradox cards, and ask to position the ideal website on a scale from 1 to 5, assuming such numbers as card extremes. It is important to get adjectives-rich answers.
Interpret. Cluster into 2-3 themes the adjectives/nouns from the answer process: each theme defines a scenario (e.g. the "Aggressive" scenario might include words as "bright red", "enthusiastic", "lion" and so on).

Doing

Define visuals: Once your scenarios are defined, you can fill a Style Tile template for each scenario, selecting the visual elements related to the scenario itself. Present the proposals to the client and discuss/iterate for the best solution.
You can do this step together with the client in a workshop, where you might want to have one team to work on a single scenario. In this case:
Prepare the template elements, making sure that colors, typefaces, images fit the different scenarios. Don't be too open, and neither too restrictive in the choice. Print the templates and the visual elements, and provide them to each team.
Let the team assemble the different visual elements on the template.
Join the teams together and let them vote for the best solution.
Processing results

Deliver the digitalized Style Tile to the client, along with the further documentation related to the web system (wireflows) or, if needed, use it to build your wireflow.

Style Tile, instructions

1.

After interviewing your clients, cluster the adjectives/nouns contained in their answers, and come up with 2-3 scenarios. Give a name to each scenario.

2.

Prepare the Style Tile elements in the template. Select a set of colors, images, typefaces suitable for the three scenarios.

3.

In the workshop, give one scenario to each team. Make sure every team has one template and a set of elements. The elements can be chosen, cut and sticked on the Style Tile.

4.

Join the teams and let them look at the scenarios altogether. Vote for the best solution.

User test

What

In a stakeholder test, the future PSS is tested with real stakeholders (users and service providers) using prototypes in a context as real as possible.

Why

The intention of the test is to efficiently learn in practice what works and what doesn"t work before actually building the system.

How

With the test, you want to figure out if:
The stakeholder understands your solution.
The solution is an answer to the problem or need of the stakeholder.
The solution motivates the stakeholder (drives).
The solution is user-friendly.

Preparing

First decide what you want to test with whom. Make sure to look back at your design requirements and stakeholders dimensions to define this.
Setup the prototype in a realistic test setting and recruit the stakeholders (users, service providers, third parties, ...).
test assignment...

Doing

Give several test subjects the same assignment. Let them conduct the test and think aloud while doing so. The project team observes the test.
Collect the test results and improve your concept by adapting what fails and strengthening what works well.
Videotape the test. Afterwards, you"ll often find details that you didn"t notice at the time. Do ask the user beforehand if they agree to being videotaped.
Note, similar to the interview, which activities the user does and which touchpoint they use in the process. Observe facial expressions and hesitation.
Take time after the test to talk through the experience"you can use the interview techniques for this. Let the test subject talk and regularly ask how and why. Avoid pushing your own viewpoint. Take notes of these conversations. You can use the interview tools for this.
Repeat these steps for the other scenarios and assignments that you want to test.

Tree testing

What

Testing the "table of contents" of a site or intranet. A tree test is a specific form of usability test, aimed at evaluating the user-friendliness of the tree structure you have created for your site or intranet during classification workshops.

Why

A classification usually is created together with stakeholders and content experts during mind mapping sessions, without involvement from users. With a tree test you check whether your hypotheses are correct and validate your classification with users.

How

Tree testing is usually done with software like Treejack which allows you to test a table of contents. But it can also be done more informally: directly in a mind map, or with MS Word in Outline view (use the heading 1, 2, 3 style to create the levels in the tree structure).


Preparing

Enter your tree structure into the tool you are going to use for the test.
Prepare a protocol, including the test tasks (typically, information retrieval questions, like "You want to do [x]. Where can you find information on how to do this?")If you are using a tool like Treejack, enter the tasks in the tool and indicate for each task the location of the correct answer(s) in the tree structure.
Recruit users for the test. Do a test run first.

Doing

Introduce the test participant to the session, using an intro script.
Go through the test tasks one by one. Don't interfere or help the test participant too much. Observe how he/she is trying to find the answers to the tasks. Ask to think aloud.
At the end of the session, ask some concluding questions.
Processing results

Software like Treejack keeps track of the success rate per task and shows you the click paths that were used. With the results of a tree test, you can directly improve and fine tune the classification. No need for an elaborate, written-out test report.

Combine a tree test, which purely focusses on the "table of contents" of your site, with more traditional user testing, e.g. start the tree test with a few tasks that include first wireframes of the user interface. You will get first feedback on the interface, but it will also help the participant to better understand how the table of contents of the site is integrated in the screens, when he/she is doing the actual tree test tasks.

Roadmap, general

What

A roadmap is a plan of action for the implementation of a product.

Why

You want to gather your key stakeholders around the project, to collectively figure out a timeline, establish key milestones and determine who is responsible for which elements of the project.

How

Assemble the design team and the critical stakeholders/partners who are responsible for implementing the idea. Print out the Roadmap template.


Doing

In the workshop, start to define the key dates for the product implementation (e.g. Pilot launch, go-to-market date, ... ), and report them on the timeline.
Determine the different roles/responsibilities involved in the project and write them on the template.
Define the major milestones in the project implementation: write them on post-its, that you can even rotate of 45Â° so that they will stand out .
Write on post-its all the actions that need to take place in the various steps of the implementation phase: you can work by examining one role at a time, or looking at all the roles in each steps of the timeline. Stick the post-its in the correct area of the map.

Transition by design

What

The transition by design is a tool to think about the implementation of the new system concept in a way that change occurs by design. You map the transition towards the desired goal by adding design interventions in time and space.

Why

When a new system is introduced within an existing system it often fails because there is too much resistance to change. The transition roadmap offers a strategy to deal with this by working from the micro to the macro.

How

The idea is to unfold your system concept along the micro (individual actors), meso (groups such as communities or organisations) and macro domains (society). You let the new system emerge within the old one.


Preparing

Define the essence - the DNA - of your solution.

Doing

Step 1 - micro: identify the elements and flows in the engine that can be implementing independently - without any links to or help from the current system elements and processes. Decribe the actors that will be involved and the tools to empower them in this step - typically knowledge and abilities. Make sure that the DNA of your solution is implemented as complete as possible in its reduced form.
Step 2 - meso: look at the elements and flows that require connection with groups and organisations. Next identify these groups and organisations that are most likely willing to collaborate because they share the same goals and values. Add additional tools to empower the transition such as financial means, exemption from rules and laws, spaces to experiment and P2P self-learning / self-organisation capabilities.
Step 3 - macro: finally look at the elements that requires involvement from society (e.g. rules or perspectives should be changed). Identify the key politicy makers and citizen groups that should be involved. Empower the transtion with tools such as lobby mechanisms, media coverage and endorsement from celebrities.
Processing results

Illustrate the diverent steps with unfolding drawing of your system model.
In the micro it's very important to look for a really friendly environment where experiments and failing are allowed.

Style guide (generic)

What

As the primary visual DNA of a company"s branding, the style guide is a document that defines and presents examples of what your brand looks like in various visual media such as print, Internet and broadcast. Basically, it forces you to define and hone your style, for a more cohesive design.

Why

You want to create consistency throughout a project, and ensure that if anyone picks up where you left off, they will have a clear set of instructions to follow. Thus, all the contents speak the same language and appear to have the same identity.

How

Doing

The style guide document is composed of different sections, that you can tailor according to the project nature and purpose. You can include:

Strategic Brand overview: in as few words as possible, make clear the vision for the project and any keywords people should keep in mind while designing;
Logos: make sure you provide logo variations and clarify minimum sizes for legibility. Provide guidelines for use and examples of what and what not to do. Also, define spacing references: rather than specifying inches or centimeters, use a portion of the logo (a letter or a shape) to set the clearance;
Colors: specify the formats for print and web, including precise values in RGB, CMYK, or Pantone, RAL, other formats if foreseen;
Typefaces: sizes, line height, spacing before and after, headline versus body font and so on. Make sure to include Web alternatives for non-Web fonts;
Layouts and grids: in Web, prepare basic generic templates in order to curb excessive creativity with the layout;
Tone of voice: when multiple people are writing the copy, the brand can start to sound like it has multiple personalities, that is why it is necessary to provide suggestions and examples on how the written contents should sound;
Imagery: describe and provide examples on the language they images should speak.
Final overview of the "assembly", examples of deliverables where the different elements are displayed together, including do's and don'ts.
Processing results

Collect all the guidelines in a final deliverable. You might want to create a double version of your document, including a complete version and a practical synthesis, easily accessible by those who are supposed to use the style guide document.

Style guide (web)

What

A Web style guide is a document that, just like branding guidelines, helps to create design consistency in all the parts of the project, from button styles to navigation structure.

Why

You want to make sure that the project is coherent and mirrors a precise identity in all its parts. Thus, anyone who needs to work on the project has a clear set of instructions to follow, especially referring to the developers who are suppposed to build the UI.

How


Doing

The style guide document is composed of different sections. In general, it follows the contents of a generic style guide, including particular attention to the UI elements in all the possible, different states.

Before developing a style guide, study the brand to understand vision, mission and values of the company. Create a document including a both visual and written explanation on the following sections (you can provide css directions too):

Typography Define the different headline types (h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6) and the body, specifying font family, weight, color as well as bold or italic variations;
Palette: define the primary colors always on a neutral background. If needed, add secondary and tertiary colors;
Voice: it is the actual copy. Stick on the corporate tone or, if needed, define it providing proper examples;
Iconography: define a set of icons. Make sure to align with the brand values, and think about target audience, religion and history, so as to avoid misunderstandings;
Imagery: make sure to include imagery that defines the kind of pictures to be used in the website: again, think about the values of the brand;
Forms: establish a hierarchy of forms and include related feedback (active and hover; error, warning and success messages; possible feedback on password being too weak, email being not valid or success messages);
Buttons: define a set of buttons, relying on color palette, forms and voice;
Spacing: always give directions on spacing. You can do it in the form of a grid used for a layout; you might also define the spacing between headlines, buttons, images, forms and other elements.
Do's and don'ts: show common pitfalls and, in the same time, how things should look like to be correct.
Processing results

Gather all the information in a coherent and clear layout.

Design specification

What

The design specification is a document that describes the design solution.

It contains the description of the wholes and the parts from an economical, human and technical point-of-view.

Why

The design specification serves as the main input to the elaboration. As this elaboration is often broken down in tasks and delegated to multiple executors, you want to ensure that everyone has a common understanding of the whole. At the same time, the document has to be detailed and specific enough for unambiguous execution by each party.

How

Doing

The design specification document is build up in layers, going from the whole to the parts. Describe:

The vision and goal of your client and the problem he wants to solve or the opportunity he wants to address (not applicable in Iware).

Add persona"s of the different stakeholder groups
Your PSS concept through the scenario"s, the blueprint, the conceptual model (and the PSS business model).
Add illustrations of the to be system map
Add the interaction moodboards
For each touchpoint: the concept sketches
For each touchpoint you elaborated further: the detailed designs and the specific requirements. (The requirements are different for each discipline - e.g. product design, urbanism, codes of conduct,"¦).
Add pictures of your prototypes
Add discipline-specific drawings, plans and descriptions.

This model illustrates how you should tackle your design project and thus also build up your design briefing. Start by looking as 360Â° as possible to the whole. Then decide which concept you want to zoom in further. Next choose within those concept the most relevant touchpoints to develop in detail. Make sure you detail at least one touchpoint for the service provider and one for the receiver.

Explanation (align with as)

Annexes

Value framework

In this framework, different definitions and models come into play: economics; psychology; sociology; and ecology. This background in (universal) values can assist you in building a meaningful value proposition that helps you to create: an experience for the user; do well for the organization; do good for the total ecosystem; and create transformation at societal level.

The five key capitals

There are five types of sustainable capital from where we derive the goods and services we need to improve the quality of our lives.

Natural Capital is any stock or flow of energy and material that produces goods and services. It includes:
Resources - renewable and non-renewable materials
Sinks - that absorb, neutralise or recycle wastes
Processes - such as climate regulation
Human Capital consists of people's health, knowledge, skills and motivation. All these things are needed for productive work.
Enhancing human capital through education and training is central to a flourishing economy.
Social Capital concerns the institutions that help us maintain and develop human capital in partnership with others; e.g. families, communities, businesses, trade unions, schools, and voluntary organisations.
Manufactured Capital comprises material goods or fixed assets which contribute to the production process rather than being the output itself " e.g. tools, machines and buildings.
Financial Capital plays an important role in our economy, enabling the other types of Capital to be owned and traded. But unlike the other types, it has no real value itself but is representative of natural, human, social or manufactured capital; e.g. shares, bonds or banknotes.
